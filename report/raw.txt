The Prime Minister is finally coming to Manipur .
On September 13, his visit—his first since the violence began—will bring him to both Churachandpur and Imphal, the symbolic hearts of the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities.
He is expected to inaugurate development projects reportedly worth Rs.8,500 crore and interact with displaced persons.
Modi’s decision to visit Manipur comes nearly 28 months after the outbreak of violence in May 2023.
During this period, families displaced by the clashes have remained in relief camps across Churachandpur, Imphal East, and other districts, often without durable rehabilitation.
Survivors continue to recount killings, sexual violence, and the absence of justice, while for many, Modi’s prolonged silence symbolised abandonment.
The ruling party’s Kuki legislators too have had it tough.
In 2023, they made repeated attempts to secure an appointment with the Prime Minister but were denied—a development that underscored the broader marginalisation of their community.
Paolienlal Haokip, a BJP MLA from the Kuki community, confirmed that party emissaries had reached out .“Yes, Sambit Patra had come to meet the party and its MLAs yesterday.
We are glad he will be coming.
Hope he has time to listen to the people’s voices,” Haokip said.
For Kuki groups, the visit represents an opportunity to press long-standing demands, including the call for a separate administration.
For the Meitei civil society, it is a test of whether Delhi will genuinely acknowledge their grievances.
But for many, including the members of Angom Prem Kumar’s family, the visit feels like too little, too late.
Thirty-six-year-old Kumar was a resident of Bijang village in Churachandpur, and lived in a relief camp in Kwakta.
On July 6, 2024, Kumar died by suicide.
He left no note, no explanation, only the grief of a mother wondering why her son, a survivor of the conflict, could no longer go on.

His story is one of thousands of silent tragedies unfolding in Manipur’s relief camps.
But it is also a testament to a deeper rot—a crisis that has long since moved past the headlines of violence and into the quiet despair of its survivors.
This is the reality of a State split in two.
More than 260 people have been killed, many have died by suicide in relief camps and almost 60,000 people are living in relief camps since the start of the violence.
The demographic map of Manipur has been redrawn: Kukis have fled Imphal, while Meiteis have consolidated in and around it.
On paper, it is a small State of just 22,347 square kilometres, yet in reality, two of its largest communities can no longer walk freely across it.
Athouba, a leading voice of the Meitei community and spokesperson of the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), an umbrella body of five major civil society organisations representing the Meiteis.
“The Prime Minister’s visit after such a long absence must not be reduced to tokenism.
It should address the core issues destabilising Manipur,” he said.
He further added, “COCOMI’s stand is clear: detecting illegal immigrants through a robust mechanism like the NRC is essential, along with the dignified resettlement of displaced families.”
“The PM must also end proxy wars in the name of the deceptive SoO [Suspension of Operation] pact and restore basic constitutional rights, especially free movement across the state.
Without these, peace will remain hollow and incomplete,” he said.
Khumujamba Meetei Leika; on the left, before the violence, and on the right, after the violence.
Entire Meitei settlements in Churachandpur have vanished, erasing the community’s presence from large swathes of the hills.
The reality is no less grim on the Kuki side.
Modi has made only rare references to the Manipur crisis since it began.
His most notable intervention came in July 2023, after a harrowing video surfaced from B.
Phainom village in Kangpokpi district.
Phainom bears the scars of that violence.
Much of the village remains deserted, its residents displaced and homes destroyed.
Although the State government has repeatedly promised to resettle those affected, satellite imagery suggests large parts of the settlement have been wiped out.
In both areas—the Kuki-dominated district Churachandpur and Meitei-dominated state capital Imphal—preparations for the Prime Minister’s visit were under way.
But on September 11, decorations near the Peace Ground in Churachandpur were set on fire.
On condition of anonymity, a resident Reena (name changed) told Frontline : “Why do we need decorations for his visit?
Our people have died and are living in pain, with no proper food or facilities in the relief camps.
If he is coming, he should be shown the ground reality instead of these decorations.”
When Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Manipur in 2023, he promised to improve medical facilities by sending doctors to the hill areas.
But the Kuki Khanglai Lawmpi (KKL), which manages health services in these regions, claims that at least 13 displaced members of the Kuki-Zo community have died since November 2024, allegedly due to lack of medical care.
Tight security arrangements are underway at Kangla Western Gate on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s arrival, in Imphal.
Still, many see Modi’s visit as momentous.
“The last Indian Prime Minister to visit our region was Rajiv Gandhi, back in 1988,” said Ginza Vuolzon, spokesperson of the Kuki-Zo Council.
“For two years we complained that the Prime Minister refused to visit us.
Now that he has decided, we are hopeful our issues will be addressed.”
The BJP’s State leadership presented the visit as a confidence-building exercise.
“This visit shows our concerns are being addressed at the highest level.
It will restore public confidence and create space for reconciliation between the two communities,” said Bikram Kongkham, the party’s State secretary.
He acknowledged that Shah’s 2023 peace committee failed to deliver results because it came at a “highly volatile” moment, but insisted that conditions are now more conducive for dialogue.
On why Modi chose to address the two communities separately, in Imphal and Churachandpur, he argued: “By visiting both places, the Prime Minister is showing that everyone is equal in the eyes of the law and the government.
This is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Prayas in action.”
The ethnic conflict in Manipur, now stretching into its third year, has been shaped as much by street-level violence as by the fate of a ceasefire agreement that was meant to prevent it.
The SoO pact, first signed in 2008 between the Centre, the Manipur government, and more than two dozen Kuki-Zo armed groups, was designed to limit hostilities by confining cadres to designated camps.
For the Meitei civil society in Imphal, however, the SoO became a symbol of impunity.
Groups in the valley repeatedly accused Kuki underground outfits of using the arrangement as cover for attacks.
By mid-2025, as the conflict dragged on, pressure mounted on the Union government not to renew the agreement.
The United People’s Front (UPF), one of the SoO signatories, responded by tying its participation in the peace process directly to its long-standing demand for a separate administration.
In an interview with Frontline , UPF spokesperson Aaron said:
B Phainom Village; on the left, before the violence, and on the right, now deserted and destroyed after the 2023 violence.
“The ethnic conflict in Manipur is a hate campaign towards the Kuki-Zo people by radical Meiteis, who call us illegal immigrants and narco-terrorists.
The Government of Manipur sided with the radicals, and hence, we were driven out from the valley.
The formation of a peace committee does not bring peace.
We don’t believe in peace without justice.
Now, we are focused on a permanent political solution—forming a separate administration for the Kuki-Zo people in Manipur.
That is the only solution right now.”
From the Meitei side, civil society leader Athouba argued that the Centre’s decision undermined democratic process:
“Signing the SoO pact during President’s Rule by overruling the decision of the State cabinet and the unanimous resolution of the assembly is illegitimate.
The appointed authority of Delhi in the State cannot represent us.”
If the SoO pact reflects the armed and political dimensions of Manipur’s conflict, it is the women’s collectives that have defined its moral ground.
The Meira Paibis, literally “women with torches”, first emerged in the 1980s in resistance to excesses under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA).
Since May 2023, they have once again taken to the streets, patrolling neighbourhoods, blocking highways, and, at times, physically confronting central forces.

“Why does the Prime Minister suddenly find interest in Manipur, or is there any other agenda for his coming?” asked Chanthoi, a Meira Paibi leader.
“If his visit can bring resettlement and peace, then it is welcome.
But if not, better not to visit here.
As Prime Minister of the country, it is his duty and responsibility to resettle the problem.
If his purpose is different, it will be like putting fuel into the fire.”
For women’s groups like the Meira Paibis, Modi’s 28 months of silence has been as significant as his imminent arrival.
The concern is that the visit will be read less as an act of reconciliation than as political theatre.
Since 2023, the people of Manipur have been demanding that Prime Minister Modi visit the State and listen to their grievances.
While Home Minister Amit Shah came in the first month of the violence and made several promises, many of those assurances remain unfulfilled.
Modi’s visit, coming nearly 28 months later, will be judged by whether it brings genuine relief and reconciliation or remains another unkept promise.
Yaqut Ali has covered Manipur’s recent violence since its start for many publications including The Wire.
He received a Pulitzer Center grant to report on the conflict from the ground, with access to both sides of the divide.
New Delhi: The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) on August 20 released the Independent People’s Tribunal on the Ongoing Ethnic Conflict in Manipur at the Press Club of India, New Delhi.
The 694-page report, authored under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph, delivers the conclusion: “The violence which erupted on May 3, 2023, was not spontaneous but planned, ethnically targeted, and facilitated by state failures.”Wide representationThe Tribunal was set up by PUCL in 2024 with a jury of eminent figures chosen deliberately from outside Manipur to ensure neutrality.
Alongside Justice Kurian Joseph, the jury included Justice K.
Kannan, Justice Anjana Prakash, former bureaucrats M.G.
Devasahayam and Swaraj Bir Singh, academics such as Uma Chakravarti and Virginius Xaxa, human rights defenders like Manjula Pradeep and Henri Tiphagne, and journalist-author Aakar Patel.Over 150 survivors gave oral testimony, while thousands more submitted accounts in writing or through group discussions.
“The voices we heard,” the jury wrote, “paint a picture of systemic impunity and targeted brutality.” The report records that more than 60,000 internally displaced people “remain in camps with no end in sight, even after 27 months of violence.”Fault lines and flashpointsThe report identified long-standing ethnic divisions, socio-political marginalisation, and land disputes as the soil in which the violence was sown.
These were aggravated by “systematic hate campaigns and political rhetoric” that amplified mistrust between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities.A major trigger was the March 27, 2023 order of the Manipur high court recommending Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meiteis.
The directive sparked fears among tribal groups – particularly Kukis and Nagas – that their constitutional protections would be eroded, the report said.
“The judgment acted as a catalyst,” the report noted, “setting off state-wide protests on May 3, which quickly descended into targeted violence.”The report also dismantled two dominant narratives: that Kukis were “illegal immigrants” from Myanmar, and that they were driving poppy cultivation.
“Both claims were found to be exaggerated and politically weaponised,” the report said, “serving to demonise the community.”Brutality and complicitySurvivor testimonies provided some of the report’s most searing insights, “We saw killings, mutilations, disrobing of women, and sexual violence on a large scale”.
Women testified that police often failed to help them, and in some instances, “handed them over to mobs.”Hate propaganda played a central role.
“Social media was flooded with incendiary content, while partisan print media coverage deepened divisions,” the report stated.One survivor told the jury: “We knew the violence was coming; the government did nothing to stop it.”The collapse of relief measures worsened suffering.
Camps lacked basic sanitation, food, and medical facilities.
Hospitals were attacked, staff fled, and patients were denied treatment on communal lines.
The report noted “serious mental health consequences – trauma, PTSD, and depression – with no institutional interventions in place.”Collapse of constitutional mechanismsThe report’s findings on law and order were particularly severe – “FIRs were selectively filed, investigations delayed, and security forces accused of active complicity.” It criticised the state government for failing to create impartial Special Investigation Teams.Even interventions by the Supreme Court were described as inadequate.
“The Gita Mittal Committee and limited CBI probes were narrow in scope, poorly resourced, and lacked follow-up,” the report observed.
Both state and central governments were indicted for “enabling impunity and worsening ethnic divides.”Recommendations for justice and peaceThe report further outlined a comprehensive roadmap to restore accountability and rebuild trust in Manipur.
It called for a permanent bench of the high court in the hill districts to ensure equal access to justice and the creation of an independent Special Investigation Team to probe thousands of pending cases, including those involving security forces.
It urged strict prosecution of hate speech and propaganda that fuelled the violence, while also advocating a restorative justice framework with reparations, acknowledgment of harm, and survivor reintegration.
Strengthened relief measures and sustained community dialogue were stressed as essential to healing deep ethnic divides.“The people of Manipur deserve more than piecemeal measures,” the report declared.
“Without a systemic response, peace cannot return.”Justice Kurian Joseph told The Wire: “Justice and accountability are non-negotiable if democracy and peace are to return to the state.”A warning for the futureTwo years since Manipur was engulfed in violence, the report’s findings remain bleak.
Survivors have consistently testified that “the state either allowed the violence to happen or actively enabled it.”The report ends with a stark warning: “if accountability is not enforced and impunity allowed to persist, Manipur could become a dangerous precedent; a template for future instances of state complicity in ethnic violence.”
IMPHAL: PM Modi begins a two-day trip to three states of the Northeast on Saturday, combining outreach with a Rs 36,000-crore development outlay focused as much on providing the healing touch to conflict-scarred Manipur as on giving the region an economic fillip.
Modi is scheduled to arrive in the Kuki heartland of Churachandpur by helicopter from Mizoram, the first stop of his tour, to address a rally at the appropriately named Peace Ground and launch projects with a combined budget of Rs 7,300 crore.
The itinerary then shifts to Imphal's historic Kangla Fort, where he will inaugurate another Rs 1,200 crore worth of projects.
This is PM Modi's first visit to the state since the outbreak of ethnic violence in May 2023, triggered by a high court order asking the govt to consider giving Meitei ST status.
Resentful that the order would help the numerically dominant Meiteis eat into their share of reserved jobs and seats in educational institutions, Kukis erupted in violent protest, leading to a conflagration that singed the state and destroyed the spell of peace the state had enjoyed for a decade.
Modi is also expected to interact with people displaced by the Meitei-Kuki conflict and still living in relief camps.
An official statement said Modi's planned engagements were "in line with his commitment to inclusive, sustainable and holistic development of Manipur".
Over 260 people were killed and 60,000-odd displaced in the cycle of violence since May 2023, leading to N Biren Singh resigning as CM on Feb 9.
President's rule was clamped on Feb 13.
Weather remains the other threat, with the administration keeping a wary eye on the skies amid IMD's forecast of heavy rain and thunderstorms coinciding with the prime ministerial visit.
Over 10,000 police, CRPF, BSF, Assam Rifles and disaster management personnel have been deployed at both venues as part of the multi-layer security designed to ensure a hitch-free trip for the PM, sources said.
"Peace is not only the absence of violence but also presence of trust, harmony and reconciliation.
PM's visit will pave the way for peace, normalcy and accelerated growth," chief secretary Puneet Kumar Goel said.
"Manipur is not just a border state but a central pillar of India's Act East Policy, a gateway to Southeast Asia and a proud guardian of India's diversity."
In Mizoram, Modi is scheduled to inaugurate the Rs 8,070-crore Bairabi-Sairang rail route connecting state capital Aizawl with the expansive Indian Railways network.
He will also flag off three new express trains, including a Rajdhani Express.
Another project in the pipeline is the Chhimtuipui river bridge on the Lawngtlai-Siaha route, meant to provide all-weather connectivity and reduce travel time by two hours.
The project is part of the strategy to support cross-border commerce under the Kaladan Multimodal Transit framework.
Modi will travel to Assam from Manipur to participate in events commemorating 100th birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Bhupen Hazarika.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Manipur today, his first trip to the state since the 2023 ethnic violence that left over 200 dead.
The Opposition has long criticised him for not reviewing the situation on the ground.
Chief Secretary Puneet Kumar Goel said Modi will arrive on September 13 to launch development projects worth Rs 8,500 crore.
He will first land in Churachandpur, among the worst-hit areas, to meet internally displaced persons and lay the foundation for projects worth over Rs 7,300 crore.
The town saw fresh clashes on Thursday, with miscreants vandalising decorations prepared for the event.
Later, the PM will address a public gathering before inaugurating projects worth over Rs 1,200 crore in Imphal.
Biren Singh praised PM Modiâ€™s Manipur visit as he laid foundation stones for Rs 1,200 crore projects, taking the stateâ€™s development push to Rs 8,500 crore.
Congress MP Jayram Ramesh said in post pn X that the people of Manipur have been undergoing tremendous pain, distress, suffering, and agony for the past 28 months ever the since the state erupted.
The people of Manipur have waited patiently for the PM to visit the state.
He has finally obliged them today.
But he was in the state, from landing till take-off, for less than 5 hours.
The PM has the time (and the inclination) to spend days campaigning and travelling across the world.
But is Manipur worth only so much to him?
UBT Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut sharply reacted to Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s visit to Manipur.
Raut said the Prime Ministerâ€™s visit does not appear serious to the people.
â€œWhen Manipur urgently needed medicine and immediate action, the government left people to die.
Where was the Prime Minister when women were being paraded naked on the streets?â€ he asked.
He further alleged that Modiâ€™s visit at this stage is nothing less than an insult to women, which is why the public is not taking it seriously.
Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said in a post on X that PM Modi's visit to Manipur was concentrated on the image of the Prime Minister rather than the ground reality.
"Today, from this land of Manipur, I will also talk to my colleagues in Nepal.
Nepal is a friend of India, a close friend.
We are connected by shared history, by faith, and are moving forward together.
Today, on behalf of the countrymen, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Sushila ji on assuming charge as the Prime Minister of the interim government in Nepal.
I am confident that she will pave the way for peace, stability and prosperity in Nepal.
Sushila ji's taking oath as the first woman Prime Minister of Nepal is a very good example of women's empowerment," says PM Modi.
PM Modi, speaking from Manipur, congratulates Nepal on upholding democracy, hails the role of its youth, and wishes a prosperous future, while congratulating Sushila Karki as the countryâ€™s first female PM.
PM Modi praises the youth of Manipur for their contributions to Indiaâ€™s defence and sports, highlighting their role in Operation Sindoor where Indian soldiers displayed exceptional valour, and pays tribute to martyr Deepak Chingakham.
He emphasizes that Indian culture is incomplete without Manipuri culture and that Manipuri players are vital to the nationâ€™s sporting achievements, calling the youth of Manipur dedicated patriots who give their heart and soul for the pride of the tricolour.
PM Modi calls any violence in Manipur â€œunfortunate,â€ stresses need for peace and development, hails Manipuri contributions to Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle, and announces Mount Harriet in Andaman renamed Mount Manipur as a tribute to Manipuri freedom fighters.
PM Modi, addressing the rally, praised te GST 2.0 reforms and said that this reform has brought the double benefit for Manipur's people, mentioning key infra projects launched in the state today.
PM Modi said, "Now this time of the 21st century is the time of the North East.
Therefore, the Government of India has continuously given priority to the development of Manipur.
As a result, the development rate of Manipur is constantly increasing.
Before 2014, the development rate of Manipur was less than one per cent.
Now, Manipur is progressing many times faster than before.
A new era of infrastructure development has begun in Manipur.
The pace of building roads and national highways in Manipur has also increased many times.
Work is also being done at a fast pace to reach every village here."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing a rally in Imphal, said that his government is working on key projects to make people's lives smooth.
The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has launched infrastructure projects in Imphal.
PM says, â€œAmong the projects launched today, two are very important, the Manipur Urban Road Project worth over Rs 3,600 crore and the Manipur Info-Tech Development Project worth over Rs 500 crore.
These projects will strengthen road infrastructure in Imphal and infuse new energy into Manipurâ€™s bright future.â€
On PM Modi's Manipur visit, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav says, "PM Modi has taken too long to go there.
The Manipur issue should be resolved as soon as possible, as it has been going on for a long time...
Many people are protesting in Assam too.
I think he should go to Assam too."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday interacted with a section of people displaced due to the Manipur ethnic violence in Imphal.
The PM listened to the concerns of the families of internally displaced persons (IDPs) at the historic Kangla Fort complex in Imphal and assured them of the Centreâ€™s commitment to restore peace and normalcy in the state, they said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in Imphal.
The PM will inaugurate/lay the foundation stone of the several infrastructure projects in the state.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday addressed the ethnic violence that has gripped Manipur since 2023, saying the land of Manipur is one of "hope and aspiration" but has been scarred by unrest.
He said he had met families staying in relief camps and came away confident that "a new dawn of hope and trust is rising in Manipur." Stressing that peace is the foundation of development, the Prime Minister pointed out that in the last 11 years several conflicts across the Northeast had been resolved through dialogue.
"We are satisfied that recently in the hills and valleys, negotiations have taken place with different groups.
These are part of the Government of India's efforts to establish peace through dialogue, respect, and mutual understanding," Modi said.
Appealing to all outfits to shun violence, he added: "I urge you to move forward on the path of peace and fulfil your dreams.
I am with you, the Government of India is with the people of Manipur."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said India is on track to become the worldâ€™s third-largest economy and stressed that Manipur is advancing in step with the rest of the nation.
"There was a time when decisions made in Delhi took decades to reach here.
Today, our Churachandpur, our Manipur, are progressing together with the country," he said.
Highlighting welfare schemes, PM Modi said nearly 60,000 houses have been built in Manipur under the Centreâ€™s housing programme, providing dignity and security to thousands of families.
He added that tap water, which a decade ago reached only 25,000â€“30,000 homes, now covers more than 3.5 lakh households in the state.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday underlined the Centre's push to boost connectivity in Manipur, calling it the foundation for development in the border state.
"Manipur is a border state, and connectivity here has always been a major challenge.
I fully understand the difficulties you have faced due to the lack of good roads," the Prime Minister said at a public gathering in Churachandpur.
He said the government had been working in a two-pronged manner since 2014 â€“ by raising budgetary allocations for roads and railways in Manipur and by expanding last-mile rural connectivity.
"That is why, since 2014, I have focused strongly on continuously improving Manipur's connectivity," he said.
Addressing the issue of ethnic violence that has claimed several hundred lives in Manipur since 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal for reconciliation.
Urging all groups to choose the path of peace, he said this was essential to secure the future of their children and to ensure lasting stability in the state.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the new Manipur Police headquarters worth ₹101 crore and ₹538 crore civil secretariat, among 17 projects with a total value of ₹1,200 crore to be unveiled during his visit to the strife-torn state today, 13 September.
A government statement said Narendra Modi will also lay the foundation stones for 14 projects worth ₹7,300 crore in Churachandpur.
This will be Modi's first visit to Manipur since ethnic violence broke out in the state two years ago.
For over two years now, Manipur has been roiled by sweeping ethnic violence that has claimed at least 260 people and displaced another 50,000 people.
The clashes, which first began between the Meitei and Kuki communities, have since spread to almost every community in the state, prompting the dismissal of the state government in February this year and imposition of Governor's rule.
As per the schedule, Narendra Modi will arrive in Churachandpur from Mizoram's Aizwal on Saturday and then proceed to Imphal.
He will also address the gathering on the occasion.
"Prime Minister will inaugurate the new Manipur Police headquarters at Mantripukhri, built at a cost of ₹101 crore, and the civil secretariat constructed at a cost of ₹ 538 crore at Mantripukhri," the statement said.
Seventeen projects will be inaugurated, including Manipur Bhavans in Delhi and Kolkata,the development of the western front of Imphal River phase-II, and Mall Road phase-II in Imphal.
Churachandpur and Imphal are the two worst-hit areas during ethnic clashes in Manipur.
On Thursday, Churachandpur witnessed fresh clashes.
Unidentified miscreants reportedly vandalised and removed decorations prepared for PM Modi’s event.
The opposition has targeted PM Modi, saying that he is visiting after two years and did not go to the place when it was burning every other day for months.
Rahul Gandhi said the visit was welcomed but added that at present, the issue of ‘vote theft’ across states was more important.
The PM will spend less than 3 hours in Manipur tomorrow.
This visit, instead of providing a force for peace and harmony, is actually going to be a farce,” Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X on Friday.
Ima (mothers) markets at four locations, development of Leishang Hiden Cultural and Heritage Park in Imphal West district, infrastructure development of five government colleges in Imphal West, Thoubal and Kakching districts, and a four-lane bridge over Irang river on Imphal-Jiribam NH-38 in Noney are among the projects to be inaugurated, according to the statement.
Institutional building with staff quarters at Saikot CHC in Churachandpur district will also be unveiled, it said.
The PM will inaugurate these infrastructure projects totalling ₹1,200 crore from Meitei-majority Imphal.
The statement said the foundation stones will be laid for the Manipur urban roads, drainage, and asset management improvement initiative worth ₹ 3,647 crore and the Manipur Infotech Development(MIND) project worth ₹ 550 crore, with infrastructure set up at Imphal for skilling and employment generation across the state.
According to it, ₹142 crore has been earmarked for working-women hostels at nine locations and ₹ 105 crore for super speciality and health care in remote and hill districts.
Modi will also lay foundation stones for infrastructure development in and around Polo Ground worth ₹ 30 crore, and the strengthening of 120 schools at a cost of ₹ 134 crore in all 16 districts.
Various projects pertaining to rural connectivity, education and tourism in parts of Manipur with a total value of ₹102 crore are also included on the list of initiatives for which the foundation stones will be laid.
Construction of a multipurpose indoor stadium worth ₹36 crore at Khuman Lampak Sports Complex in Imphal, and upgradation of NH 102 A in Tengnoupal sections worth ₹ 502 crore, are also on the list.
BJP North East in-charge Sambit Patra said here on Friday that Modi will not only launch all these projects but also interact with internally displaced persons (IDPs).
Addressing a press conference here at the BJP state headquarters, Patra said, "Modi will interact with IDPs, children, women and elderly people.
He will then go to the Peace Ground where he will unveil various development projects, besides addressing the gathering."
"Thereafter, the PM would reach Imphal around 2 pm and go to Kangla.
The first thing he will do there is interact with the IDPs.
Following that, he will inaugurate various projects and address a public rally," Patra added.
Underscoring that his government was taking inspiration from Manipuri personalities, PM Modi Saturday said that any violence in the state was “unfortunate”.
While speaking in Imphal, he recalled the contribution of the soldiers during Operation Sindoor and added that the “valour of many brave sons and daughters of Manipur is also included in this success of India”.
On his first visit to the state since ethnic violence broke out nearly two years ago, the PM said the violence is a great injustice to “our ancestors and our future generations,” and highlighted the need to take “Manipur forward on the path of peace and development”.
Message to Nepal: From the stage in Imphal, Modi also spoke about the political upheaval in Nepal and shared a message for the youth in the neighbouring country.
“From the last few days, young men and women of Nepal can be seen cleaning and painting the roads of Nepal with great hard work…Their positive thinking and positive work are not only inspiring but are also a clear indication of the new rise of Nepal.
I wish Nepal all the best for its bright future.”
The PM had earlier in the day arrived in Manipur’s Churachandpur district and interacted with people displaced due to the ethnic violence and laid the foundation stone of development works.
Why the visit is important: While his visit has been welcomed by the Meiteis and the Kuki-Zo, their statements have been framed in contrasting ways.
While the Kuki-Zos have asked for a separate state or Union Territory, a Meitei group has called for an NRC -like exercise to detect undocumented immigrants and address what it sees as “demographic imbalance.” Here are their demands.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday asserted that Bharat Ratna awardee Bhupen Hazarika's songs continue to unite India and give energy to its people.
Addressing the musical doyen's birth centenary celebrations, Modi said his creations encompass the concept of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
“Bhupen da may not be present physically, but his voice gives energy to people.
His music encompasses the concept of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'.
He was rooted in the cultural traditions of India,” the PM said.

The Kuki-Zo Council (KZC) submitted a memorandum to the PM Narendra Modi during his visit to Churachandpur, demanding a “lasting political solution” in the form of a “separate administration”.
The Prime Minister visited Manipur for the first time since ethnic violence broke out in the state in May 2023.

I have also seen their pictures on social media.
Their positive thinking and positive work are not only inspiring but also a clear indication of Nepal's new rise.
I wish Nepal all the best for its bright future," he said.
"Even today, several sons of Manipur are engaged in protecting mother India in different parts of the country.
During Operation Sindoor, the world saw India’s capabilities.
Indian forces unleashed such havoc that Pakistan began running for cover.
In this operation, the courage and bravery of many sons and daughters of Manipur was also a part.
I salute the bravery and sacrifice of one such martyr, Deepak Chingakham, today.
The country will always remember his sacrifice during Operation Sindoor," PM Modi said.

Things of daily needs were out of reach of the people.
We have dealt with that problem now.
To make your life better and easy, we have decreased GST rates.
These will decrease the price of things of daily needs.
Prices of cement and building material is going to go down.
New GST rates will also benefit hoteliers and guesthouse owners."

So that people can stay at cheap rates, Manipur bhawans have been built there."
"Our government is working with all sensitivity, to deal with your problems.
Government is working on several projects to deal with floods," he added.
"Manipur is one state where women are at the forefront of the economy.
The IMA Kaithal tradition is an evidence of that.
I consider women power as the fulcrum of India’s growth and Atmanirbhar Bharat.
After our government came to power, we started setting up Ima markets here.
We have inaugurated four Ima markets today.
They will help women citizens of the state," he said.
Work is on to improve road networks both in urban and rurak areas.

Projects worth hudreds of cxorers are in the works.
Be it Imphal or other areas of Manipur, new opportunities are coming up for startups and new industries.
IT special economic zone will help such possibilities.
The first building of this zone has already been built.
The new secretariat building has also been built," he added.
"After independence, development happened in western and southern india, youth got opportunities.
This 21st century is of the east, the north east.
That is why government has always prioritised development of Manipur.

Activists of the youth wings of the Congress and Manipur Peoples' Party (MPP) held demonstrations near Prime Minister Narendra Modi's programme venue in Imphal on Saturday, protesting against the PM's trip to the strife-torn state and terming it a “political ploy”.
Holding placards, the workers of the Manipur Peoples' Party Youth Front raised slogans outside its office here and claimed that the PM's visit is “not aimed at restoration of peace and normalcy” in the state.

Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Saturday urged the people of Churachandpur not to allow illegal settlements of "people beyond the borders", asserting that the government was committed to taking effective steps to address this challenge.

With the inauguration of the Bairabi-Sairang railway line today, Mizoram has now been officially connected to the country’s rail network.
Along with three new passenger trains linking Aizawl to Kolkata, Delhi, and Guwahati, the Ministry of Railways is also set to launch freight train services.
This will reduce logistics costs and enhance trade opportunities.
Mizoram’s first goods train will commence operations tomorrow, September 14 (Sunday).
With this, the region will be benefitted from the transportation of cement, steel, and household goods via the new railway line, making these products more affordable.
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Manipur for the first time since ethnic violence hit the state in May 2023, the Congress on Saturday called it a âfarce, tokenism, and a grave insult to a wounded peopleâ.
Over the last two years, the Congress has repeatedly demanded that the prime minister visit Manipur, with the party even raising the issue of Modiâs âsilenceâ in Parliament on multiple occasions.
On Saturday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said PM Modiâs â3-hour pit stop in Manipur is not compassionâ, but is âfarce, tokenism, and a grave insult to a wounded peopleâ.
âYour so-called roadshow in Imphal and Churachandpur today, is nothing but a cowardly escape from hearing the cries of people in relief camps,â said Kharge in a post on X.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, said that educational facilities are being increased in tribal areas of the district, underlining that the government's goal is to make Manipur a symbol of peace, prosperity and progress.
"The number of Eklavya Model Schools is being increased in tribal areas.
Even in Manipur, 18 Eklavya Model Residential Schools are being built," he said, adding they will "increase educational facilities in the hills."
He further said, "Manipur’s culture has been one to promote women power.
Our government too is engaged in empowering women.
The government is also building working women hostel."
"We have a goal to make Manipur a symbol of peace, prosperity and progress.

I once again congratulate all of you for the development projects inaugurated today," he concluded.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, said that local body governance is being strengthened in the state.
"It is government’s effort that local body governance is strengthened.
Appropriate funds are being arranged for the development of local bodies.
The development of every tribal community is a priority for the country," Modi said.
"For the first time a programme, Dharti Aba Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, for the upliftment of tribals is being run.
Under this, development works are being carried out in more than 500 villages in Manipur," he added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, appealed to them and their organisations to move ahead on the path of peace.

"At any place, peace is imperative for development.
In the past 11 years, decades-old disputes in the Northeast have been resolved.
People have chosen the path of peace.
They have given priority to development," he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, assured them that a new dawn of hope is "knocking on the doors of Manipur."
Describing the benefits of his schemes in tribal districts in Manipur, Modi said, "Tribal hill districts would earlier dream of good hospitals and colleges.
Today, Churachandpur has a medical college.
New doctors are coming, and healthcare has improved.
We have given medical colleges to the hills.
Under the PM's Divine scheme, we are developing modern healthcare in five hill districts.
Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, government is giving free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh to people.
In Manipur, 5 lakh people have availed of the scheme.
If this scheme was not there, the poor in Manipur would have had to spent Rs 350 crore from their pocket.
It is our priority to take care of the problems of poor."
"This land of Manipur is the land of hope and aspirations.
But, unfortunately, violence took over this magnificent region.
I met those victims a few moments ago who are living in camps.
After talking to them, I can say that the new dawn of hope and belief is knocking on the doors of Manipur," he added.

There was a time when announcements would be made in Delhi and it would take decades for it to reach here.
Hailing his government's work in Manipur, he said, "The PM Away Yojana scheme has reached thousands of families in Manipur as well.
As many as 60,000 houses have been built under this here.
There used to be a power problem here.
Now, 1 lakh families have been given free power connection.
There was drinking water problem.
More than 15 crore countrymen have now got this facility.
In Manipur, only 25-3000 people had water connection.
Now 3.5 lakh households have it.
I am sure every household will get it in time."
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur's Churachandpur district on Saturday, said, "Manipur is a border state.
Connectivity has been a challenge here.
Because of paucity of good roads, people have faced problems.
After 2014, I have laid emphasis that work is done on Manipur’s connectivity."
"For this, we worked at two levels.
We increased the budget of rail and roads.
We laid stress on taking roads to both towns and villages.
We have spent Rs 3,700 crore on national highways here.
Another Rs 8,700 crore are being spent on new national highways.
Earlier it was very difficult to reach villages.
Now, roads reach 100s of villages.
Hill and tribal villages have benefited with this," Modi told the gathering.
He also announced that the Jiribam-Imphal railway line will soon connect Imphal to the national railway network.
The government is spending Rs 22,000 crore on this project.

Referring to Manipur as the land of courage and valour, Modi said, "I can never forget the love I received on my way to Churachandpur from Imphal by road."
"This land of Manipur is a land of courage and grit.
These hills are a gift of the nature.
They are also a symbol of your hardwork.
Because of heavy rainfall, my helicopter could not take off, so I took the road.
What I saw on the roads, I thanked the Almighty that I came by road.
Throughout the route, I saw Indian tricolour in the hands of the people.
The vibrancy and diversity of this region is India’s strength.
Manipur’s name itself has Mani (jewel).
In future, this will only increase the shine of the region.
We are committed to take Manipur on the road to development," Modi told the gathering.
"The projects worth Rs 7,000 crore that were just inaugurated will make the lives of the people of Manipur better.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday laid the foundation stone for various development works in Manipur's Churachandpur district, news agency PTI reported.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit comes amid a fragile calm on the ground and persistent criticism from the Opposition over what they call the government’s initial silence and hesitance in dealing with the crisis.
With Manipur still under President’s Rule and peace talks delicately balanced, Modi’s words and actions during the trip will be closely scrutinised.
For Modi, the upcoming visit carries political and symbolic weight.
His absence from Manipur since the outbreak has been a persistent line of attack from the Opposition, which has accused him of “abandoning” the state in its worst crisis in decades.
By travelling now, more than two years after the first clashes, the Prime Minister seeks to project a narrative of restored calm and reinforce the Centre’s role as guarantor of peace.
Here's why this visit is significant.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently being welcomed in Manipur's Churachandpur district as he arrives in the city by road on Saturday.
The PM will lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,300 crore at Churachandpur today.
Owing to heavy rainfall in Manipur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday flew to Imphal from Mizoram, and is currently on his way to Churchandpur via road for his event there.
His earlier plan entailed flying via helicopter from Mizoram to Churachandpur, and then travelling to Imphal.
While Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Manipur has been welcomed by the Meiteis and the Kuki-Zo, their statements have been framed in contrasting ways.
While the Kuki-Zo have welcomed the revised Suspension of Operations (SoO) pact with Kuki militant groups signed on September 4, the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a Meitei civil society organisation, has condemned it.
Here's how their demands differ.
He is scheduled to interact with people displaced by the conflict and make public addresses, as part of which he will inaugurate and lay foundation stones for various projects.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a gathering virtually in Aizawl, hailed the work of his government in the Northeast, saying that the region is becoming the growth engine of India.
"For a long time, some political parties in our country practised vote bank politics… The entire Northeast including states like Mizoram suffered greatly because of this attitude.
But our approach is very different.
Those who were earlier neglected are at the forefront now.
Those who were once marginalized are the mainstream now.
For the past 11 years, we have been working for the development of Northeast.
This region is becoming the growth engine of India.
Over the years, many states of the Northeast have been put on the rail map of India," he said.
"Mizoram has a major role in both our Act East policy and the emerging north east economic corridor.
With the Kaladan multi modal transit transport project and railway line, Mizoram will also get connected to the Bay of Bengal through Southeast Asia.
Due to this, trade and tourism will be boosted across Northeast India and Southeast Asia," he added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a gathering virtually in Aizawl, said, "This is a historic day for the nation, particularly for the people of Mizoram.
From today, Aizawl will be on India’s railway map.
A few years ago, I had the opportunity of laying the foundation stone for the Aizawl railway line and today, we proudly dedicate it to the people of the nation.
Overcoming many challenges including difficult terrain, this Bairabi-Saayirang railw line has become a reality, The skills of our engineers and the spirit of our workers make it possible."
"Our hearts have always been connected with each other.
Now, for the first time, Sairang in Mizoram will be connected directly to Delhi by Rajdhani Express.
This is not just a railway connection.
But it is a lifeline of transformation.
It will revolutionaize the lives and livelihoods of the people of Mizoram," he said as he inaugurated the railway line.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s itinerary in Mizoram was affected by inclement weather conditions, leading him to deliver his address through video conference, and virtually inaugurate the Bairabi-Sairang Railway line from Lengpui Airport, which is around 30 km from state capital Aizawl.
Addressing a gathering virtually from the airport, Modi said, “I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you all, and welcome Aizawl to the railway map of India.
Today, due to the weather, I could not come to Aizawl, but I am sure we will meet very soon.”
His next stop, Churachandpur in Imphal, where is scheduled to reach by a helicopter from Mizoram, is also experiencing rainfall.

Responding to the resignation of N Biren Singh as the Chief Minister of the state of Manipur in India yesterday, Aakar Patel, chair of the board at Amnesty International India, said:
“Biren Singh’s resignation presents in Manipur the opportunity for the authorities to uphold and ensure human rights for everyone, break with the violence and impunity of the past and work towards ending the ethnic violence in the state which has claimed the lives of more than 250 people in the last two years.
The (BJP)-led governments at both state and central level have utterly failed to end the violence in Manipur, impunity of vigilante groups, and the divisive rhetoric that has flamed the ethnic violence.
Their actions have led to repression of dissenting voices and an abject humanitarian crisis in the state.
“By the continued failure to hold to account those suspected to be responsible for serious human rights violations, the government risks sending the message that the impunity for these violations will continue.
This in turn will fuel further violations.
Unlike the emblematic cases taken over by the Central Bureau of Investigation, like the case of the gang-rape of two Kuki women in May 2023 that found the Manipur police complicit – many lesser-known ones continue to struggle for attention of the state and central governments.
Homes, business, villages and places of worship have been burnt down, attacked, looted and vandalised.
The resignation of Biren Singh comes after the Supreme Court of India earlier this month ordered for a sealed-cover report from the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory into audio tapes that allegedly had him saying that the ethnic violence in the state had been instigated at his insistence.
In July 2024, Amnesty International documented the ongoing violence and impunity in Manipur state.
Every year, Write for Rights brings together people from around the world to fight for justice and dignity and to build a shared future.
It can take less than a minute to take action and change a life today.

PM Modi to visit Manipur today, will meet victims of 2023 violence
Two years after ethnic clashes rocked Manipur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to visit the northeastern state to inaugurate development projects.
The visit will pave the way for peace, normalcy, and growth in the state, said the state Chief Secretary.
For over two years, the Opposition has targeted the Prime Minister for not visiting the state to personally review the situation in the conflict-hit northeastern region.
Manipur Chief Secretary Puneet Kumar Goel announced that the Prime Minister will arrive on September 13 to inaugurate development projects worth Rs 8,500 crore.
PM Modi will first land in Churachandpur where he will interact with some of the internally displaced persons in the district.
"The PM's September 13 visit to Manipur will pave the way for peace, normalcy, and growth in the state," he added.
After the foundation-laying ceremony, PM Modi will address a public gathering before inaugurating projects worth over 1,200 crore in the state capital, Imphal.
Reacting to PM's visit, Rahul Gandhi said it is not a big deal any more as the state has been in trouble for a long time.
He added that the main issue is now of voter theft.
"Manipur has been in trouble for a long time and the PM has decided to go there now.
The main issue today in India is 'vote chori' (vote theft)," said Gandhi.
He added, "The election mandates in Haryana and Maharashtra were stolen...People everywhere are saying 'Vote Chor'..."
Besides Manipur, the Prime Minister will also visit other northeastern states, including Mizoram and Assam, before heading to West Bengal and poll-bound Bihar.
Tomorrow, he will begin his tour in Mizoram, where he will lay the foundation stone and inaugurate multiple development projects worth over Rs 9,000 crore in Aizawl.
Following this, he will travel to Manipur.
Later in the evening, the Prime Minister will visit Assam to take part in the centenary celebrations of Bharat Ratna Dr.
At around 5 PM, he will also address the gathering on the occasion.
On September 14, the Prime Minister will again be in Assam to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of major infrastructure and industrial development projects worth over Rs 18,530 crore.
The following day, September 15, he will head to West Bengal to inaugurate the 16th Combined Commanders’ Conference-2025 in Kolkata.
Thereafter, the Prime Minister will travel to Bihar, where he is scheduled to inaugurate the new terminal building of Purnea airport at around 2:45 PM.
The Supreme Court Monday sought a sealed-cover report from the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory, which is examining the “leaked audio tapes” that, according to a Kuki body, established Manipur CM N Biren Singh’s role in fuelling ethnic conflict in the state.
A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar directed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for Manipur, that the report be produced before it on the next date of hearing on March 24.

The petitioner, Kuki Organization for Human Rights Trust, has sought an independent investigation based on the tapes into Biren’s alleged role in the violence, which has killed more than 200 people in Manipur since May 2023.
The Manipur government has termed the clips as fake and said that they were released on social media in an attempt to derail peace initiatives.
“It is pointed out that audio clips have been sent for examination by the CFSL.
The report would be produced in sealed cover before the court on the next date of hearing,” the court directed.
At the very outset, CJI Khanna told Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for the petitioner, “There are two things.
One — the state is gradually limping back to normalcy.
The second issue is whether we should entertain it or the High Court should entertain it.”
Bhushan said the transcripts of the tapes were “very serious” and implicated the CM.
The CJI said he had not gone through the transcripts.
Bhushan said the petitioner had sent the tapes to Truth Labs which has “far more expertise and credibility than CFSL…” and that the lab had said it was “his (Biren’s) voice” in the tapes.
SG Mehta pointed out that Truth Labs was run by private individuals.
He said the “petitioner has some ideological inclinations” and that the court-appointed committee of former judges has filed reports saying “these civil society organisations are wanting to keep the pot boiling… That appears to be the intention.
Let that not happen.”
Mehta was referring to the Justice Gita Mittal Committee, which was constituted by the SC last August to address the humanitarian concerns stemming from the violence.
Mehta said an FIR had already been lodged in August and the petition was filed in November: “My objection is not delay only but we said that whatever they have supplied has been sent to CFSL and a report is awaited.
Whoever has uploaded on their Twitter (X) account, we have approached them also (asking) if you have the original, please give it to us so that (its veracity can be checked).”
The CJI said, “We are careful.
That’s why I said in the beginning itself.
This should not become another issue.”
“At the same time, I don’t know the contents of the transcripts, and the veracity also.
That’s for you people to examine… Let the FSL report come,” the CJI added.
Meanwhile, the SC made it clear that the state’s objection as to why the petitioner could not have approached the HC will remain open and Monday’s order will have no bearing on it.

“The focus on connectivity, infrastructure, education and health care has brought hope and new opportunities to our youths.
Today, as we look forward, we also acknowledge the challenges that we must face together, challenges of peace, development and trust,” he added.
Bhalla said taking development to the remotest corner of the country is the cornerstone of the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ or developed India.
“It is the time to heal and look forward with dialogue, understanding and inclusive governance.
We must all contribute to bring peace to our society,” he said.
“Churachandpur district has been the top priority of the State.
Being a border district, the government is committed to providing connectivity and essential infrastructure,” he said.

A peace march conducted by a Meitei body was stopped in Manipur's Imphal West district on Saturday as the programme coincided with the government's initiative to resume inter-district bus services to ensure free movement of people, police said.

Members of the Meitei body insisted that free movement means travel by anybody and demanded that they be allowed to go in the vehicles arranged by them.
"If they (volunteers) wanted to participate in the free movement initiative, they may go through the vehicles arranged by the government," a police officer said.
Federation of Civil Society Organisations president T Manihar said, "The purpose of the march is to bring peace in the state.
If the government is not in a position to allow the free movement of the public, what is the need for making the announcement?"

Manipur: Media persons say their route was blocked en route to Shirui Lily Festival
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning, the day when the five-day festival is scheduled to commence in Ukhrul district.
A media team en route to cover the opening ceremony of the 5th Shirui Lily Festival in Manipur was forced to return after personnel of the MAHAR Regiment and Border Security Force (BSF) allegedly blocked their bus at Gwaltabi in Imphal East district.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning, the day when the five-day festival is scheduled to commence in Ukhrul district.
The festival is being held for the first time since ethnic violence erupted in the state in May 2023.
On May 8, Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla chaired the second organising committee meeting for the festival at Raj Bhavan in Imphal, where key issues including budget allocation, scheduling, security, transport logistics, crowd management, accommodation, cultural programming, and promotional strategies were discussed.
As part of logistical arrangements, the Manipur State Transport (MST) had issued a notice on May 6 announcing dedicated bus services from Imphal to Ukhrul between May 20 and 24.
Three buses were to operate between the Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT), Imphal, and Shirui Public Ground, Ukhrul, at a fare of ₹200 per passenger.
According to an order issued by the Director of Information and Public Relations (DIPR), Manipur, on May 19, a dedicated transport service for media personnel covering the festival was arranged from the DIPR office at Nityaipat Chuthek, Imphal.
Security on National Highway 202, which connects Imphal East to Ukhrul, has been handed over to BSF and Army personnel ahead of the festival.
Although Ukhrul is a Naga-dominated district that remained largely unaffected by the ethnic conflict, a heavy security presence was deemed necessary since Meitei attendees would have to travel through six Kuki-Zo villages Mongneljang, Gwaltabi, Zalenbung, Mongot-Chepu, Litan, and Sareikhong located along the route.
Two other villages, Thawai Kuki and Zaolen, are situated nearby.
In a public notice issued on Monday, Ukhrul additional deputy commissioner Polly Makan advised all travellers to use the Yaingangpokpi route between 8am and 4pm.
“Visitors travelling after 4pm will be escorted by security personnel,” and noted that “no movement will be permitted after midnight to ensure safety and order,” she said.
When contacted, members of the media team claimed that they were being stopped at multiple checkpoints between Imphal and Ukhrul.
“When we reached near Gwaltabi, Imphal East, the BSF personnel told us to remove the ‘Manipur State Transport’ signage from the bus.
We covered the MST markings with paper, but later, another team from the MAHAR Regiment arrived and said the bus could not proceed further,” a member of the media team said.
“We were scheduled to cover the festival’s inaugural function at 11am.
If we are detained until 10am, how are we supposed to report on the event?
We were not going to Ukhrul to have lunch...we were on assignment,” the journalist added.
Eventually, the team hired a private vehicle and returned to Imphal.
The other MST buses were also made to spray-paint on the ‘Manipur State Transport’ signage and were then allowed to proceed.
Earlier, on March 8, the MST had resumed services following instructions from Union home minister Amit Shah, allowing free movement across all roads in Manipur.
However, buses were attacked in Kangpokpi district by Kuki-Zo protesters demanding the suspension of MST services in their dominated areas until their demand for a separate administration, specifically a Union Territory, is fulfilled.
Media team blocked by MAHAR Regiment and BSF while traveling to Shirui Lily Festival in Manipur, forcing them to return.
Festival begins amid heightened security tensions, with checkpoints and restrictions on travel routes between Imphal and Ukhrul districts.
Several Meitei families displaced by ethnic violence are gearing up to return to their homes on the periphery of Manipur ’s Imphal Valley under security cover.
Officials in the State’s Imphal West district said a few people had begun cleaning the houses they abandoned after the conflict between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities broke out on May 3, 2023, leaving more than 250 dead over two years.
In some cases, the people began repairing their houses damaged or destroyed during the peak of the conflict.
Their families are expected to move in after the houses are made liveable.
The district authorities and security forces enabled the displaced people from a village of 21 households in New Keithelmanbi to clean and repair their houses.
The village is on the boundary with the Kangpokpi district, dominated by the Kuki-Zo community.
“The displaced people are being resettled in their original homes in coordination with the Deputy Commissioners of the adjoining districts.
After returning home, they will continue to receive ration and benefits under the State livelihood mission,” Imphal West’s Deputy Commissioner Mayanglambam Rajkumar told journalists after inspecting a few deserted fringe villages on Tuesday.
“Security will be provided to the people wherever there is a possibility of their returning home,” he said.
On July 4, the State’s former Chief Secretary, Prashant Kumar Singh, said the first of a three-phase resettlement plan for the internally displaced people, chalked out in association with the Centre, was under way.
He claimed that about 5,000 of some 62,000 people displaced in the violence had returned to their villages.
He also said the government planned to rehabilitate most of the displaced people by December and subsequently close the relief camps, many in educational institutions.
The Manipur government is expected to provide a financial assistance of ₹3.03 lakh each to the 7,000-8,000 families, whose houses were destroyed during the violence, so that they can rebuild them wherever they want.
The government, however, is aware that about 10,000 Meitei people would not be able to go back to their homes in the Kuki-majority Moreh (Tengnoupal district), Kangpokpi, and Churachandpur districts.
They will be given the option of staying in some 1,000 prefabricated houses being built by Manipur Police Housing Corporation Limited.
A similar arrangement will be made for the Kuki-Zo people who may be unable to return to Imphal Valley.

The Centre on Thursday (April 17, 2025) informed the Supreme Court that a forensic report on the authenticity of leaked audio clips alleging the role of former Manipur Chief Minister N.
Biren Singh in the ethnic violence in the State was ready and would be filed shortly in a sealed cover.
A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna took note of the submissions of a counsel appearing for the Centre and the State government to this effect and deferred the hearing on a plea filed by the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust (KOHUR) in the week commencing May 5.
The counsel said the report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) will be filed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and sought an adjournment, saying the law officer was unavailable at the moment.
Singh resigned as the chief minister of Manipur on February 9, amid rumblings within the State BJP and growing demands for a change of leadership.
Earlier, the top court sought a sealed-cover forensic report from the CFSL on the authenticity of the leaked audio clips alleging Mr.
Singh's role in the ethnic violence that began in May 2023.
KOHUR, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, had sought a court-monitored SIT probe into Mr.
"The state is gradually limping back to normalcy and we will keep it (the matter) on hold at the moment," the CJI had said, adding he would see later whether the top court or the high court should hear the case.
The solicitor general agreed with the observations.

calls it ‘anti-national’ activity
Mr.
Bhushan termed the contents of the audio leaks a "very serious matter" and said Mr.
Singh was purportedly heard saying that Meitei groups were allowed to loot arms and ammunition of the State government.
"I have annexed transcripts of tape recordings," he added.
The solicitor general said the petitioner had "ideological inclinations" and there was a report by a committee of three high court judges which stated that there were efforts to keep the "pot boiling".
“A truth lab confirmed that 93% it is the voice of the chief minister,” said Mr.
Bhushan, “and truth labs are far more reliable than the FSL reports.”
The law officer, however, questioned the veracity of the truth lab report.
On November 8 last year, a Bench headed by former CJI D.Y.
Chandrachud directed KOHUR to produce material to indicate the authenticity of some of the leaked audio clips.
Bhushan had said he would also file a copy of the tape in a CD format.
S-G Mehta, however, said the plea could be filed in the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution.
More than 260 people have been killed and thousands displaced since the ethnic violence broke out between the Imphal valley-based Meitei and neighbouring hills-based Kuki communities in May 2023.
The clashes began after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against an order of the Manipur High Court on the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status.
Bhushan alleged that the recorded conversation prima facie showed the complicity and involvement of the State machinery in the violence against the Kuki Zo community.
He said the clips had "disturbing conversations" and Mr.
Singh could be heard instigating the violence and protecting the attackers.
Singh was instrumental in "inciting, organising and thereafter centrally orchestrating the large-scale murder, destruction and other forms of violence against the Kuki-dominated areas in Manipur".
"Petitioner is praying for a court-monitored investigation by special investigation team into the leaked audio tape clips as there is clear and strong prima facie evidence showing involvement of the highest functionary, i.e., chief minister of a State.
The investigation would need to unearth the conspiracy which appears to involve the highest functionary of state," it said.
NationSC seeks forensic report on audio tapes alleging Manipur CM's role in ethnic violence
The court was informed that the audio tapes were examined by 'Truth Labs', a private forensic science laboratory, which certified that the voice belonged to CM Biren Singh.
NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report on the examination of certain leaked audio tapes which allegedly implicate Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh for instigating ethnic violence in the state.
A bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said the CFSL report should be submitted in six weeks in a sealed cover.
The bench then posted the hearing in the week commencing on March 24.
"Relist in the week commencing on March 24, 2025.
The report will be produced in sealed cover," the bench stated in its order.
The order of the top court came on a petition filed by the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust seeking an independent investigation into the audio tapes.
During the hearing, Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Manipur government, alleged that the petitioner was carrying certain "ideological baggage" with a "separatist mindset."
Mehta said that even the judges' panel constituted by the Supreme Court has raised concerns about certain civil society organisations wanting to "keep the pot boiling."
CJI said he has not gone into the contents and veracity of the audio tapes and sought report by CFSL.
Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench that the audio tapes were examined by 'Truth Labs', a private forensic science laboratory, which certified that the voice belongs to the Chief Minister by over 93 per cent.
The report of the 'Truth Labs,' carries more credibility than any government agencies' report, he said.
The plea filed by a Kuki group organisation sought a court-monitored investigation into the alleged audio clips.
The Kuki group claimed that it had audio tapes shared by a whistle-blower of telephone conversations held by the Chief Minister "establishing complicity of the highest functionary and others in ethnic violence in the state of Manipur."
The top court is also seized of the cases relating to the violence in Manipur between Meitei and Kuki communities.
The violence in Manipur between the Hindu Meiteis and the tribal Kuki, who are Christians, erupted after a rally by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM) on May 3, 2023.
Violence has gripped the entire state since May 2023 and both the Central and state governments led by BJP, have come under fire for failing to stop it.
Two districts of Manipur remained tense on Friday (June 20, 2025), a day after unknown gunmen injured a Meitei farmer and a Kuki woman was shot dead later.
A shutdown was observed across the Churachandpur district, dominated by the Kuki-Zo people, to protest the woman’s killing.
She was identified as Hoikholhing Haokip, the wife of the chief of Langchingmanbi village adjoining the Bishnupur district, where the Meitei farmer was attacked.

The Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum had called the shutdown, demanding “immediate action against those responsible for this atrocity, concrete steps from the Centre to ensure the protection of tribal lives and territory, and an independent investigation into the repeated buffer zone violations.”
The people of Bishnupur, one of the five districts comprising the Meitei-majority Imphal Valley, continued to block a highway leading to the Churachandpur district.
They demanded the arrest of the assailants of farmer Ningthoujam Biren Singh, who was shot in his left arm on Thursday.
Earlier, the Manipur Police said the security forces came under fire from unknown armed miscreants after the farmer was shot in Bishnupur’s Phubala area.
“...the forces retaliated accordingly.
During the crossfire, one woman from Langchingmanbi village was found dead with a bullet injury,” it said.
Manipur, scarred by the ethnic conflict between the Kuki-Zos and Meiteis, was relatively calm after the imposition of the President’s Rule on February 13 this year.
More than 250 people had died and some 60,000 were displaced in the clashes that had erupted on May 3, 2023.
Meanwhile, the All Manipur United Clubs’ Organisation (AMUCO) condemned the Phubala incident, saying it suspected a conspiracy between the attackers and the security forces.
It said the incident happened near a bunker of the Sashastra Seema Bal, whose personnel were inactive.
The organisation underlined the importance of holding accountable the security personnel found complicit or negligent, apart from the attackers.
“The people of Manipur express deep dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Home Affairs’ performance, as the region continues to grapple with ongoing conflicts and violence despite the government’s claims of working towards restoring normalcy,” the AMUCO said.
The organisation also questioned the work done by security adviser Kuldiep Singh, who was sent by the Centre to resolve the ongoing crisis plaguing the State.
