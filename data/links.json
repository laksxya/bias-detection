        "content": "Published : Sep 13, 2025 10:37 IST  - 8  MINS  READ COMMents SHARE READ LATER SEE ALL Remove Banners in Imphal welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his first visit to the State since the outbreak of violence, which continues to grip it more than two years later.\n                                          | Photo Credit: By Special Arrangement The Prime Minister is finally coming to Manipur .  On September 13, his visit—his first since the violence began—will bring him to both Churachandpur and Imphal, the symbolic hearts of the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities. He is expected to inaugurate development projects reportedly worth Rs.8,500 crore and interact with displaced persons. Modi’s decision to visit Manipur comes nearly 28 months after the outbreak of violence in May 2023. During this period, families displaced by the clashes have remained in relief camps across Churachandpur, Imphal East, and other districts, often without durable rehabilitation. Survivors continue to recount killings, sexual violence, and the absence of justice, while for many, Modi’s prolonged silence symbolised abandonment. The ruling party’s Kuki legislators too have had it tough. In 2023, they made repeated attempts to secure an appointment with the Prime Minister but were denied—a development that underscored the broader marginalisation of their community. Paolienlal Haokip, a BJP MLA from the Kuki community, confirmed that party emissaries had reached out .“Yes, Sambit Patra had come to meet the party and its MLAs yesterday. We are glad he will be coming. Hope he has time to listen to the people’s voices,” Haokip said. For Kuki groups, the visit represents an opportunity to press long-standing demands, including the call for a separate administration. For the Meitei civil society, it is a test of whether Delhi will genuinely acknowledge their grievances. But for many, including the members of Angom Prem Kumar’s family, the visit feels like too little, too late. Thirty-six-year-old Kumar was a resident of Bijang village in Churachandpur, and lived in a relief camp in Kwakta. On July 6, 2024, Kumar died by suicide. He left no note, no explanation, only the grief of a mother wondering why her son, a survivor of the conflict, could no longer go on. Also Read | The uneasy truth PUCL’s Manipur tribunal brings to light His story is one of thousands of silent tragedies unfolding in Manipur’s relief camps. But it is also a testament to a deeper rot—a crisis that has long since moved past the headlines of violence and into the quiet despair of its survivors. This is the reality of a State split in two. More than 260 people have been killed, many have died by suicide in relief camps and almost 60,000 people are living in relief camps since the start of the violence. The demographic map of Manipur has been redrawn: Kukis have fled Imphal, while Meiteis have consolidated in and around it. On paper, it is a small State of just 22,347 square kilometres, yet in reality, two of its largest communities can no longer walk freely across it. Frontline spoke to K.H. Athouba, a leading voice of the Meitei community and spokesperson of the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), an umbrella body of five major civil society organisations representing the Meiteis. “The Prime Minister’s visit after such a long absence must not be reduced to tokenism. It should address the core issues destabilising Manipur,” he said. He further added, “COCOMI’s stand is clear: detecting illegal immigrants through a robust mechanism like the NRC is essential, along with the dignified resettlement of displaced families.” “The PM must also end proxy wars in the name of the deceptive SoO [Suspension of Operation] pact and restore basic constitutional rights, especially free movement across the state. Without these, peace will remain hollow and incomplete,” he said. Khumujamba Meetei Leika; on the left, before the violence, and on the right, after the violence.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                By Special Arrangement Entire Meitei settlements in Churachandpur have vanished, erasing the community’s presence from large swathes of the hills. The reality is no less grim on the Kuki side. Modi has made only rare references to the Manipur crisis since it began. His most notable intervention came in July 2023, after a harrowing video surfaced from B. Phainom village in Kangpokpi district. Today, B. Phainom bears the scars of that violence. Much of the village remains deserted, its residents displaced and homes destroyed. Although the State government has repeatedly promised to resettle those affected, satellite imagery suggests large parts of the settlement have been wiped out. In both areas—the Kuki-dominated district Churachandpur and Meitei-dominated state capital Imphal—preparations for the Prime Minister’s visit were under way. But on September 11, decorations near the Peace Ground in Churachandpur were set on fire. On condition of anonymity, a resident Reena (name changed) told Frontline : “Why do we need decorations for his visit? Our people have died and are living in pain, with no proper food or facilities in the relief camps. If he is coming, he should be shown the ground reality instead of these decorations.” When Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Manipur in 2023, he promised to improve medical facilities by sending doctors to the hill areas. But the Kuki Khanglai Lawmpi (KKL), which manages health services in these regions, claims that at least 13 displaced members of the Kuki-Zo community have died since November 2024, allegedly due to lack of medical care. Tight security arrangements are underway at Kangla Western Gate on the eve of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s arrival, in Imphal.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                ANI Still, many see Modi’s visit as momentous. “The last Indian Prime Minister to visit our region was Rajiv Gandhi, back in 1988,” said Ginza Vuolzon, spokesperson of the Kuki-Zo Council. “For two years we complained that the Prime Minister refused to visit us. Now that he has decided, we are hopeful our issues will be addressed.” The BJP’s State leadership presented the visit as a confidence-building exercise. “This visit shows our concerns are being addressed at the highest level. It will restore public confidence and create space for reconciliation between the two communities,” said Bikram Kongkham, the party’s State secretary. He acknowledged that Shah’s 2023 peace committee failed to deliver results because it came at a “highly volatile” moment, but insisted that conditions are now more conducive for dialogue. On why Modi chose to address the two communities separately, in Imphal and Churachandpur, he argued: “By visiting both places, the Prime Minister is showing that everyone is equal in the eyes of the law and the government. This is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Prayas in action.” The ethnic conflict in Manipur, now stretching into its third year, has been shaped as much by street-level violence as by the fate of a ceasefire agreement that was meant to prevent it. The SoO pact, first signed in 2008 between the Centre, the Manipur government, and more than two dozen Kuki-Zo armed groups, was designed to limit hostilities by confining cadres to designated camps. For the Meitei civil society in Imphal, however, the SoO became a symbol of impunity. Groups in the valley repeatedly accused Kuki underground outfits of using the arrangement as cover for attacks. By mid-2025, as the conflict dragged on, pressure mounted on the Union government not to renew the agreement. On September 4, the Centre signed a revised and renewed the SoO pact with Kuki-Zo insurgent groups, rather than withdrawing from it. The new agreement re-established a framework for “political dialogue” but also included stricter terms, such as the reaffirmation of Manipur’s “territorial integrity”. The United People’s Front (UPF), one of the SoO signatories, responded by tying its participation in the peace process directly to its long-standing demand for a separate administration. In an interview with Frontline , UPF spokesperson Aaron said: B Phainom Village; on the left, before the violence, and on the right, now deserted and destroyed after the 2023 violence.\n                                                            | Photo Credit: \n                                By Special Arrangement “The ethnic conflict in Manipur is a hate campaign towards the Kuki-Zo people by radical Meiteis, who call us illegal immigrants and narco-terrorists. The Government of Manipur sided with the radicals, and hence, we were driven out from the valley. The formation of a peace committee does not bring peace. We don’t believe in peace without justice. Now, we are focused on a permanent political solution—forming a separate administration for the Kuki-Zo people in Manipur. That is the only solution right now.” From the Meitei side, civil society leader Athouba argued that the Centre’s decision undermined democratic process: “Signing the SoO pact during President’s Rule by overruling the decision of the State cabinet and the unanimous resolution of the assembly is illegitimate. The appointed authority of Delhi in the State cannot represent us.” If the SoO pact reflects the armed and political dimensions of Manipur’s conflict, it is the women’s collectives that have defined its moral ground. The Meira Paibis, literally “women with torches”, first emerged in the 1980s in resistance to excesses under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). Since May 2023, they have once again taken to the streets, patrolling neighbourhoods, blocking highways, and, at times, physically confronting central forces. Also Read | Why Manipur is burning again “Why does the Prime Minister suddenly find interest in Manipur, or is there any other agenda for his coming?” asked Chanthoi, a Meira Paibi leader. “If his visit can bring resettlement and peace, then it is welcome. But if not, better not to visit here. As Prime Minister of the country, it is his duty and responsibility to resettle the problem. If his purpose is different, it will be like putting fuel into the fire.” For women’s groups like the Meira Paibis, Modi’s 28 months of silence has been as significant as his imminent arrival. The concern is that the visit will be read less as an act of reconciliation than as political theatre. Since 2023, the people of Manipur have been demanding that Prime Minister Modi visit the State and listen to their grievances. While Home Minister Amit Shah came in the first month of the violence and made several promises, many of those assurances remain unfulfilled. Modi’s visit, coming nearly 28 months later, will be judged by whether it brings genuine relief and reconciliation or remains another unkept promise. Yaqut Ali has covered Manipur’s recent violence since its start for many publications including The Wire. He received a Pulitzer Center grant to report on the conflict from the ground, with access to both sides of the divide.

        "content": "Since 2015, The Wire has done just that. But we can continue only with your support . New Delhi: The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) on August 20 released the Independent People’s Tribunal on the Ongoing Ethnic Conflict in Manipur at the Press Club of India, New Delhi. The 694-page report, authored under the chairmanship of former Supreme Court judge Justice Kurian Joseph, delivers the conclusion: “The violence which erupted on May 3, 2023, was not spontaneous but planned, ethnically targeted, and facilitated by state failures.” Wide representation The Tribunal was set up by PUCL in 2024 with a jury of eminent figures chosen deliberately from outside Manipur to ensure neutrality. Alongside Justice Kurian Joseph, the jury included Justice K. Kannan, Justice Anjana Prakash, former bureaucrats M.G. Devasahayam and Swaraj Bir Singh, academics such as Uma Chakravarti and Virginius Xaxa, human rights defenders like Manjula Pradeep and Henri Tiphagne, and journalist-author Aakar Patel.  Over 150 survivors gave oral testimony, while thousands more submitted accounts in writing or through group discussions. “The voices we heard,” the jury wrote, “paint a picture of systemic impunity and targeted brutality.” The report records that more than 60,000 internally displaced people “remain in camps with no end in sight, even after 27 months of violence.” Fault lines and flashpoints  The report identified long-standing ethnic divisions, socio-political marginalisation, and land disputes as the soil in which the violence was sown. These were aggravated by “systematic hate campaigns and political rhetoric” that amplified mistrust between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities. A major trigger was the March 27, 2023 order of the Manipur high court recommending Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meiteis . The directive sparked fears among tribal groups – particularly Kukis and Nagas - that their constitutional protections would be eroded, the report said. “The judgment acted as a catalyst,” the report noted, “setting off state-wide protests on May 3 , which quickly descended into targeted violence.” The report also dismantled two dominant narratives: that Kukis were “illegal immigrants” from Myanmar, and that they were driving poppy cultivation. “Both claims were found to be exaggerated and politically weaponised,” the report said, “serving to demonise the community.” Brutality and complicity Survivor testimonies provided some of the report’s most searing insights, \"We saw killings, mutilations, disrobing of women, and sexual violence on a large scale\". Women testified that police often failed to help them, and in some instances, “handed them over to mobs.” Hate propaganda played a central role. “Social media was flooded with incendiary content, while partisan print media coverage deepened divisions,” the report stated. One survivor told the jury: “We knew the violence was coming; the government did nothing to stop it.” The collapse of relief measures worsened suffering. Camps lacked basic sanitation, food, and medical facilities. Hospitals were attacked, staff fled, and patients were denied treatment on communal lines. The report noted “serious mental health consequences – trauma, PTSD, and depression – with no institutional interventions in place.” Collapse of constitutional mechanisms The report’s findings on law and order were particularly severe – “FIRs were selectively filed, investigations delayed, and security forces accused of active complicity.” It criticised the state government for failing to create impartial Special Investigation Teams. Even interventions by the Supreme Court were described as inadequate. “The Gita Mittal Committee and limited CBI probes were narrow in scope, poorly resourced, and lacked follow-up,” the report observed. Both state and central governments were indicted for “enabling impunity and worsening ethnic divides.” Recommendations for justice and peace The report further outlined a comprehensive roadmap to restore accountability and rebuild trust in Manipur. It called for a permanent bench of the high court in the hill districts to ensure equal access to justice and the creation of an independent Special Investigation Team to probe thousands of pending cases, including those involving security forces. It urged strict prosecution of hate speech and propaganda that fuelled the violence, while also advocating a restorative justice framework with reparations, acknowledgment of harm, and survivor reintegration. Strengthened relief measures and sustained community dialogue were stressed as essential to healing deep ethnic divides. “The people of Manipur deserve more than piecemeal measures,” the report declared. “Without a systemic response, peace cannot return.” Justice Kurian Joseph told The Wire : “Justice and accountability are non-negotiable if democracy and peace are to return to the state.” A warning for the future Two years since Manipur was engulfed in violence, the report’s findings remain bleak. Survivors have consistently testified that “the state either allowed the violence to happen or actively enabled it.” The report ends with a stark warning: “if accountability is not enforced and impunity allowed to persist, Manipur could become a dangerous precedent; a template for future instances of state complicity in ethnic violence.” The Wire is now on WhatsApp. Follow our channel for sharp analysis and opinions on the latest developments."

        "content": "Manipur Ex-Chief Minister N. Biren Singh praised PM Modi’s Manipur visit as he laid foundation stones for Rs 1,200 crore projects, taking the state’s development push to Rs 8,500 crore. Congress MP Jayram Ramesh said in post pn X that the people of Manipur have been undergoing tremendous pain, distress, suffering, and agony for the past 28 months ever the since the state erupted. The people of Manipur have waited patiently for the PM to visit the state. He has finally obliged them today. But he was in the state, from landing till take-off, for less than 5 hours. The PM has the time (and the inclination) to spend days campaigning and travelling across the world. But is Manipur worth only so much to him? It is shockingly insensitive. UBT Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut sharply reacted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Manipur. Raut said the Prime Minister’s visit does not appear serious to the people. “When Manipur urgently needed medicine and immediate action, the government left people to die. Where was the Prime Minister when women were being paraded naked on the streets?” he asked. He further alleged that Modi’s visit at this stage is nothing less than an insult to women, which is why the public is not taking it seriously. Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said in a post on X that PM Modi's visit to Manipur was concentrated on the image of the Prime Minister rather than the ground reality. The first step on the journey to peace and healing in Manipur should have been Prime Minister Modi’s visit to the state two years ago. Now two years late his visit should primarily be about respecting the sentiments of the Northeast. Instead the optics are tone deaf and…  \"Today, from this land of Manipur, I will also talk to my colleagues in Nepal. Nepal is a friend of India, a close friend. We are connected by shared history, by faith, and are moving forward together. Today, on behalf of the countrymen, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Sushila ji on assuming charge as the Prime Minister of the interim government in Nepal. I am confident that she will pave the way for peace, stability and prosperity in Nepal. Sushila ji's taking oath as the first woman Prime Minister of Nepal is a very good example of women's empowerment,\" says PM Modi.  PM Modi, speaking from Manipur, congratulates Nepal on upholding democracy, hails the role of its youth, and wishes a prosperous future, while congratulating Sushila Karki as the country’s first female PM.  PM Modi praises the youth of Manipur for their contributions to India’s defence and sports, highlighting their role in Operation Sindoor where Indian soldiers displayed exceptional valour, and pays tribute to martyr Deepak Chingakham. He emphasizes that Indian culture is incomplete without Manipuri culture and that Manipuri players are vital to the nation’s sporting achievements, calling the youth of Manipur dedicated patriots who give their heart and soul for the pride of the tricolour.  PM Modi calls any violence in Manipur “unfortunate,” stresses need for peace and development, hails Manipuri contributions to India’s freedom struggle, and announces Mount Harriet in Andaman renamed Mount Manipur as a tribute to Manipuri freedom fighters. PM Modi, addressing the rally, praised te GST 2.0 reforms and said that this reform has brought the double benefit for Manipur's people, mentioning key infra projects launched in the state today. PM Modi said, \"Now this time of the 21st century is the time of the North East. Therefore, the Government of India has continuously given priority to the development of Manipur. As a result, the development rate of Manipur is constantly increasing. Before 2014, the development rate of Manipur was less than one per cent. Now, Manipur is progressing many times faster than before. A new era of infrastructure development has begun in Manipur. The pace of building roads and national highways in Manipur has also increased many times. Work is also being done at a fast pace to reach every village here.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing a rally in Imphal, said that his government is working on key projects to make people's lives smooth. The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has launched infrastructure projects in Imphal. PM says, “Among the projects launched today, two are very important, the Manipur Urban Road Project worth over Rs 3,600 crore and the Manipur Info-Tech Development Project worth over Rs 500 crore. These projects will strengthen road infrastructure in Imphal and infuse new energy into Manipur’s bright future.” On PM Modi's Manipur visit, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav says, \"PM Modi has taken too long to go there. The Manipur issue should be resolved as soon as possible, as it has been going on for a long time... Many people are protesting in Assam too. I think he should go to Assam too.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday interacted with a section of people displaced due to the Manipur ethnic violence in Imphal. The PM listened to the concerns of the families of internally displaced persons (IDPs) at the historic Kangla Fort complex in Imphal and assured them of the Centre’s commitment to restore peace and normalcy in the state, they said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has arrived in Imphal. The PM will inaugurate/lay the foundation stone of the several infrastructure projects in the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday addressed the ethnic violence that has gripped Manipur since 2023, saying the land of Manipur is one of \"hope and aspiration\" but has been scarred by unrest. He said he had met families staying in relief camps and came away confident that \"a new dawn of hope and trust is rising in Manipur.\" Stressing that peace is the foundation of development, the Prime Minister pointed out that in the last 11 years several conflicts across the Northeast had been resolved through dialogue. \"We are satisfied that recently in the hills and valleys, negotiations have taken place with different groups. These are part of the Government of India's efforts to establish peace through dialogue, respect, and mutual understanding,\" Modi said. Appealing to all outfits to shun violence, he added: \"I urge you to move forward on the path of peace and fulfil your dreams. I am with you, the Government of India is with the people of Manipur.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said India is on track to become the world’s third-largest economy and stressed that Manipur is advancing in step with the rest of the nation. \"There was a time when decisions made in Delhi took decades to reach here. Today, our Churachandpur, our Manipur, are progressing together with the country,\" he said. Highlighting welfare schemes, PM Modi said nearly 60,000 houses have been built in Manipur under the Centre’s housing programme, providing dignity and security to thousands of families. He added that tap water, which a decade ago reached only 25,000–30,000 homes, now covers more than 3.5 lakh households in the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday underlined the Centre's push to boost connectivity in Manipur, calling it the foundation for development in the border state. \"Manipur is a border state, and connectivity here has always been a major challenge. I fully understand the difficulties you have faced due to the lack of good roads,\" the Prime Minister said at a public gathering in Churachandpur. He said the government had been working in a two-pronged manner since 2014 – by raising budgetary allocations for roads and railways in Manipur and by expanding last-mile rural connectivity. \"That is why, since 2014, I have focused strongly on continuously improving Manipur's connectivity,\" he said. Addressing the issue of ethnic violence that has claimed several hundred lives in Manipur since 2023, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal for reconciliation. Urging all groups to choose the path of peace, he said this was essential to secure the future of their children and to ensure lasting stability in the state."

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the new Manipur Police headquarters worth ₹ 101 crore and ₹ 538 crore civil secretariat, among 17 projects with a total value of ₹ 1,200 crore to be unveiled during his visit to the strife-torn state today, 13 September. A government statement said Narendra Modi will also lay the foundation stones for 14 projects worth ₹ 7,300 crore in Churachandpur. This will be Modi's first visit to Manipur since ethnic violence broke out in the state two years ago. For over two years now, Manipur has been roiled by sweeping ethnic violence that has claimed at least 260 people and displaced another 50,000 people. The clashes, which first began between the Meitei and Kuki communities , have since spread to almost every community in the state, prompting the dismissal of the state government in February this year and imposition of Governor's rule. As per the schedule, Narendra Modi will arrive in Churachandpur from Mizoram's Aizwal on Saturday and then proceed to Imphal. Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth over ₹ 7,300 crore at Churachandpur at around 12:30 PM. He will also address the gathering on the occasion. The Prime Minister will also inaugurate various projects worth over ₹ 1,200 crore at Imphal, at around 2:30 PM and address a public function. \"Prime Minister will inaugurate the new Manipur Police headquarters at Mantripukhri, built at a cost of ₹ 101 crore, and the civil secretariat constructed at a cost of ₹ 538 crore at Mantripukhri,\" the statement said. Seventeen projects will be inaugurated, including Manipur Bhavans in Delhi and Kolkata,the development of the western front of Imphal River phase-II, and Mall Road phase-II in Imphal. Churachandpur and Imphal are the two worst-hit areas during ethnic clashes in Manipur. On Thursday, Churachandpur witnessed fresh clashes . Unidentified miscreants reportedly vandalised and removed decorations prepared for PM Modi’s event. The opposition has targeted PM Modi, saying that he is visiting after two years and did not go to the place when it was burning every other day for months. Rahul Gandhi said the visit was welcomed but added that at present, the issue of ‘vote theft’ across states was more important. “So now it is official. The PM will spend less than 3 hours in Manipur tomorrow. This visit, instead of providing a force for peace and harmony, is actually going to be a farce,” Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X on Friday. Ima (mothers) markets at four locations, development of Leishang Hiden Cultural and Heritage Park in Imphal West district, infrastructure development of five government colleges in Imphal West, Thoubal and Kakching districts, and a four-lane bridge over Irang river on Imphal-Jiribam NH-38 in Noney are among the projects to be inaugurated, according to the statement. Institutional building with staff quarters at Saikot CHC in Churachandpur district will also be unveiled, it said. The PM will inaugurate these infrastructure projects totalling ₹ 1,200 crore from Meitei-majority Imphal. Modi will lay foundation stones for various development projects worth ₹ 7,300 crore from Peace Ground in Churachandpur, where Kukis are in the majority. The statement said the foundation stones will be laid for the Manipur urban roads, drainage, and asset management improvement initiative worth ₹ 3,647 crore and the Manipur Infotech Development (MIND) project worth ₹ 550 crore, with infrastructure set up at Imphal for skilling and employment generation across the state. According to it, ₹ 142 crore has been earmarked for working-women hostels at nine locations and ₹ 105 crore for super speciality and health care in remote and hill districts. Modi will also lay foundation stones for infrastructure development in and around Polo Ground worth ₹ 30 crore, and the strengthening of 120 schools at a cost of ₹ 134 crore in all 16 districts. Various projects pertaining to rural connectivity, education and tourism in parts of Manipur with a total value of ₹ 102 crore are also included on the list of initiatives for which the foundation stones will be laid.

        "content": "Which language would you like to use this site in? Responding to the resignation of N Biren Singh as the Chief Minister of the state of Manipur in India yesterday, Aakar Patel, chair of the board at Amnesty International India, said: “Biren Singh’s resignation presents in Manipur the opportunity for the authorities to uphold and ensure human rights for everyone, break with the violence and impunity of the past and work towards ending the ethnic violence in the state which has claimed the lives of more than 250 people in the last two years.  The (BJP)-led governments at both state and central level have utterly failed to end the violence in Manipur, impunity of vigilante groups, and the divisive rhetoric that has flamed the ethnic violence. Their actions have led to repression of dissenting voices and an abject humanitarian crisis in the state. “By the continued failure to hold to account those suspected to be responsible for serious human rights violations, the government risks sending the message that the impunity for these violations will continue. This in turn will fuel further violations.  Unlike the emblematic cases taken over by the Central Bureau of Investigation, like the case of the gang-rape of two Kuki women in May 2023 that found the Manipur police complicit – many lesser-known ones continue to struggle for attention of the state and central governments. This must change.” Biren Singh’s resignation presents in Manipur the opportunity for the authorities to uphold and ensure human rights for everyone, break with the violence and impunity of the past… Since May 2023, more than 60,000 people have been displaced in Manipur due to the ongoing violence between the dominant ethnic community, the Meities and the other minority ethnic communities including the Kukis. Homes, business, villages and places of worship have been burnt down, attacked, looted and vandalised. The resignation of Biren Singh comes after the Supreme Court of India earlier this month ordered for a sealed-cover report from the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory into audio tapes that allegedly had him saying that the ethnic violence in the state had been instigated at his insistence. In July 2024, Amnesty International documented the ongoing violence and impunity in Manipur state.  Every year, Write for Rights brings together people from around the world to fight for justice and dignity and to build a shared future. It can take less than a minute to take action and change a life today. If you are talented and passionate about human rights then Amnesty International wants to hear from you. © 2025 Amnesty International"

        "content": "Underscoring that his government was taking inspiration from Manipuri personalities, PM Modi Saturday said that any violence in the state was “unfortunate”. While speaking in Imphal, he recalled the contribution of the soldiers during Operation Sindoor and added that the “valour of many brave sons and daughters of Manipur is also included in this success of India”. On his first visit to the state since ethnic violence broke out nearly two years ago, the PM said the violence is a great injustice to “our ancestors and our future generations,” and highlighted the need to take “Manipur forward on the path of peace and development”. Message to Nepal: From the stage in Imphal, Modi also spoke about the political upheaval in Nepal and shared a message for the youth in the neighbouring country. “From the last few days, young men and women of Nepal can be seen cleaning and painting the roads of Nepal with great hard work…Their positive thinking and positive work are not only inspiring but are also a clear indication of the new rise of Nepal. I wish Nepal all the best for its bright future.” The PM had earlier in the day arrived in Manipur’s Churachandpur district and interacted with people displaced due to the ethnic violence and laid the foundation stone of development works. Why the visit is important: While his visit has been welcomed by the Meiteis and the Kuki-Zo, their statements have been framed in contrasting ways. While the Kuki-Zos have asked for a separate state or Union Territory, a Meitei group has called for an NRC -like exercise to detect undocumented immigrants and address what it sees as “demographic imbalance.” Here are their demands. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday asserted that Bharat Ratna awardee Bhupen Hazarika's songs continue to unite India and give energy to its people. Addressing the musical doyen's birth centenary celebrations, Modi said his creations encompass the concept of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'. “Bhupen da may not be present physically, but his voice gives energy to people. His songs unite India. His music encompasses the concept of ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat'. He was rooted in the cultural traditions of India,” the PM said. --PTI The Kuki-Zo Council (KZC) submitted a memorandum to the PM Narendra Modi during his visit to Churachandpur, demanding a “lasting political solution” in the form of a “separate administration”. The Prime Minister visited Manipur for the first time since ethnic violence broke out in the state in May 2023. The KZC, a leading civil society organisation, argued that the hill-based Kuki-Zo people could no longer live under the “domination” of the valley-based polity and sought Union Territory (UT) status with a legislature under Article 239A of the Constitution for their region. PM Narendra Modi inaugurated the Bairabi-Sairang rail line, connecting Aizawl to Indian Railways for the first time. He also announced development works worth Rs 9,000 crore and flagged off three new express trains. The state's role in Act East Policy and North East Economic Corridor was highlighted. PM Modi praised the culture and announced GST reforms. The 51.38-km line has opened new opportunities. Read more here While concluding his speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, \"In the 21st century, our country is moving forward with one objective - Viksit Bharat. And Manipur's development is integral for the fulfilment of this objective. Manipur is full of immense possibilities.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, \"Today, from this land of Manipur, I will also talk to my colleagues in Nepal. Nepal is a friend of India, a close friend. We are connected by shared history, by faith, and are moving forward together.\" \"Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Sushila Karki on becoming Nepal's first female PM, calling it a shining example of women's empowerment. \"Today, on behalf of the countrymen, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Smt. Sushila ji on assuming charge as the Prime Minister of the interim government in Nepal. I am confident that she will pave the way for peace, stability and prosperity in Nepal. Sushila ji's taking oath as the first woman Prime Minister of Nepal is a very good example of women's empowerment,\" he said. He praised Nepalese citizens for upholding democratic values. \"Today, I praise each such individual in Nepal who, despite such atmosphere of instability, has upheld democratic values...For the last few days, Nepal's youth can be seen working hard to clean and paint the roads of Nepal. I have also seen their pictures on social media. Their positive thinking and positive work are not only inspiring but also a clear indication of Nepal's new rise. I wish Nepal all the best for its bright future,\" he said. \"From the last few days, young men and women of Nepal can be seen cleaning and painting the roads of Nepal with great hard work. I have also seen their pictures on social media. Their positive thinking and positive work are not only inspiring but are also a clear indication of the new rise of Nepal. I wish Nepal all the best for its bright future,\" he added. \"Even today, several sons of Manipur are engaged in protecting mother India in different parts of the country. During Operation Sindoor, the world saw India’s capabilities. Indian forces unleashed such havoc that Pakistan began running for cover. In this operation, the courage and bravery of many sons and daughters of Manipur was also a part. I salute the bravery and sacrifice of one such martyr, Deepak Chingakham, today. The country will always remember his sacrifice during Operation Sindoor,\" PM Modi said. \"We have to take inspiration from the contribution that Manipur has made in India’s freedom struggle. It was in Manipur that Indian National Army for the first time unfurled India’s flag. Netaji Subhas had called Manipur the door to India’s freedom. This land has made many brave sacrifices. Our government is moving forward drawing inspiration from the people of this land,\" PM Modi said. \"In Andaman and Nicobar, we have changed the name of Mount Harriot to Mount Manipur,\" he added. \"Manipur has a cultural heritage of thousands of years. Cultural roots are strong and deep here. Manipur is the jewel of India. We have to continuously keep reinforcing Manipur’s developmental image. Any kind of violence in Manipur is unfortunate. It is an injustice to Manipur’s forefathers and the future generations. We have to continuously take Manipur ahead on the road of peace and progress. And we have to do it together,\" said PM Modi  PM Narendra Modi said, \"Manipur has seen those days when making goods reach here was so difficult. Things of daily needs were out of reach of the people. We have dealt with that problem now. To make your life better and easy, we have decreased GST rates. These will decrease the price of things of daily needs. Prices of cement and building material is going to go down. New GST rates will also benefit hoteliers and guesthouse owners.\" PM Narendra Modi said, \"Many from Manipur go to Delhi and Kolkata. So that people can stay at cheap rates, Manipur bhawans have been built there.\" \"Our government is working with all sensitivity, to deal with your problems. Government is working on several projects to deal with floods,\" he added. \"Manipur is one state where women are at the forefront of the economy. The IMA Kaithal tradition is an evidence of that. I consider women power as the fulcrum of India’s growth and Atmanirbhar Bharat. After our government came to power, we started setting up Ima markets here. We have inaugurated four Ima markets today. They will help women citizens of the state,\" he said. PM Modi said, \"A new era of infrastructure development has been ushered into Manipur. Work is on to improve road networks both in urban and rurak areas. Imphal city is a city of possibilities. I see Imphal as a city that will realise the dreams of the youth and controibute to the country’s growth.\" \"With that vision, under the smart city mission, several projects have been completed. Projects worth hudreds of cxorers are in the works. Be it Imphal or other areas of Manipur, new opportunities are coming up for startups and new industries. IT special economic zone will help such possibilities. The first building of this zone has already been built. The new secretariat building has also been built,\" he added. \"After independence, development happened in western and southern india, youth got opportunities. This 21st century is of the east, the north east. That is why government has always prioritised development of Manipur. That is why Manipur’s growth rate is continuously increasing. Before 2014, the growth rate of Manipur was less than 1%. Now Manipur is growing at a much faster pace,\" PM Modi said. Addressing the gathering, PM Modi said, \"For Manipur's development funds worths 1000s of crores have been allocated for projects across the state. These projects will enhance your ease of living, help strengthen infrastructure and generate employment for the youth.\" \"The Prime Minister highlighted to of the most important projects under the umbrella of development works across the state - Manipur Urban Road Project and Manipur Infotech Development Project worth over Rs 3,600 crores and Rs 500 crores, respectively,\" he added. Mizoram Chief Minister Lalduhoma on Saturday said it was a historic day as the state entered the country's railway map, which will have a far-reaching impact as it bridges the dreams and reality between the state and Bharat. He was addressing a gathering as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Mizoram's first railway line and flagged off the state's maiden Rajdhani Express, connecting Aizawl with Delhi. (PTI) Activists of the youth wings of the Congress and Manipur Peoples' Party (MPP) held demonstrations near Prime Minister Narendra Modi's programme venue in Imphal on Saturday, protesting against the PM's trip to the strife-torn state and terming it a “political ploy”. Holding placards, the workers of the Manipur Peoples' Party Youth Front raised slogans outside its office here and claimed that the PM's visit is “not aimed at restoration of peace and normalcy” in the state. (PTI) Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Saturday urged the people of Churachandpur not to allow illegal settlements of \"people beyond the borders\", asserting that the government was committed to taking effective steps to address this challenge. Addressing a public meeting in Churachandpur, from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled development projects worth Rs 7,300 crore, Bhalla said he was confident that Manipur will emerge more resilient, united and prosperous. — PTI With the inauguration of the Bairabi-Sairang railway line today, Mizoram has now been officially connected to the country’s rail network.  Along with three new passenger trains linking Aizawl to Kolkata, Delhi, and Guwahati, the Ministry of Railways is also set to launch freight train services. This will reduce logistics costs and enhance trade opportunities.  Mizoram’s first goods train will commence operations tomorrow, September 14 (Sunday). With this, the region will be benefitted from the transportation of cement, steel, and household goods via the new railway line, making these products more affordable.  Here's all you need to know. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Manipur for the first time since ethnic violence hit the state in May 2023, the Congress on Saturday called it a “farce, tokenism, and a grave insult to a wounded people”.  Over the last two years, the Congress has repeatedly demanded that the prime minister visit Manipur, with the party even raising the issue of Modi’s “silence” in Parliament on multiple occasions.  On Saturday, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said PM Modi’s “3-hour pit stop in Manipur is not compassion”, but is “farce, tokenism, and a grave insult to a wounded people”.  “Your so-called roadshow in Imphal and Churachandpur today, is nothing but a cowardly escape from hearing the cries of people in relief camps,” said Kharge in a post on X.  Read the full story here.   . @narendramodi ji Your 3-hour PIT STOP in Manipur is not compassion — it’s farce, tokenism, and a grave insult to a wounded people. Your so-called ROADSHOW in Imphal and Churachandpur today, is nothing but a cowardly escape from hearing the cries of people in relief camps!…  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, said that educational facilities are being increased in tribal areas of the district, underlining that the government's goal is to make Manipur a symbol of peace, prosperity and progress.  \"The number of Eklavya Model Schools is being increased in tribal areas. Even in Manipur, 18 Eklavya Model Residential Schools are being built,\" he said, adding they will \"increase educational facilities in the hills.\"  He further said, \"Manipur’s culture has been one to promote women power. Our government too is engaged in empowering women. The government is also building working women hostel.\"  \"We have a goal to make Manipur a symbol of peace, prosperity and progress. I assure you that for the development of Manipur, to rehabilitate the displaced, for establishing peace, the government of India will keep cooperating with the Manipur government. I once again congratulate all of you for the development projects inaugurated today,\" he concluded. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, said that local body governance is being strengthened in the state. \"It is government’s effort that local body governance is strengthened. Appropriate funds are being arranged for the development of local bodies. The development of every tribal community is a priority for the country,\" Modi said. \"For the first time a programme, Dharti Aba Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, for the upliftment of tribals is being run. Under this, development works are being carried out in more than 500 villages in Manipur,\" he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, appealed to them and their organisations to move ahead on the path of peace.  \"I appeal to all organisations to move on the path of peace, and realise your dreams. Ensure the future of your children. And I promise to you today: I am with you,\" he told the gathering.  \"The government of India is with you, with the people of Manipur. The government is making all efforts to bring back normalcy to Manipur. The government is providing assistance to build 7000 homes for the displaced,\" Modi highlighted  \"Recently we have approved a special package of Rs 3000 crore to help the displaced, Rs 500 crore has been specially provisioned. I am aware of the dreams and struggles of the tribal youth of Manipur. To address your concerns, work is happening at different levels,\" he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, said that work is being done to establish peace in the violence-hit district. \"At any place, peace is imperative for development. In the past 11 years, decades-old disputes in the Northeast have been resolved. People have chosen the path of peace. They have given priority to development,\" he said. \"I am happy that recently, a dialogue has been started with different groups for reconciliation in the hills and the Valley. The Indian government is a part of these efforts, working to establish peace, while giving importance to dialogue, respect and mutual understanding,\" he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, assured them that a new dawn of hope is \"knocking on the doors of Manipur.\"  Describing the benefits of his schemes in tribal districts in Manipur, Modi said, \"Tribal hill districts would earlier dream of good hospitals and colleges. Today, Churachandpur has a medical college. New doctors are coming, and healthcare has improved. We have given medical colleges to the hills. Under the PM's Divine scheme, we are developing modern healthcare in five hill districts. Under Ayushman Bharat Yojana, government is giving free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh to people. In Manipur, 5 lakh people have availed of the scheme. If this scheme was not there, the poor in Manipur would have had to spent Rs 350 crore from their pocket. It is our priority to take care of the problems of poor.\"  \"This land of Manipur is the land of hope and aspirations. But, unfortunately, violence took over this magnificent region. I met those victims a few moments ago who are living in camps. After talking to them, I can say that the new dawn of hope and belief is knocking on the doors of Manipur,\" he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur’s Churachandpur district on Saturday, said that Manipur and its district Churachandpur are developing along with the country. \"India is growing fast. We are going to become the third largest economy in the world very soon. We want development to reach every corner of the country. There was a time when announcements would be made in Delhi and it would take decades for it to reach here. Today Churachandpur and Manipur is developing along with the country,\" he said. Hailing his government's work in Manipur, he said, \"The PM Away Yojana scheme has reached thousands of families in Manipur as well. As many as 60,000 houses have been built under this here. There used to be a power problem here. Now, 1 lakh families have been given free power connection. There was drinking water problem. So we started Nal Jal scheme. More than 15 crore countrymen have now got this facility. In Manipur, only 25-3000 people had water connection. Now 3.5 lakh households have it. I am sure every household will get it in time.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the people of Manipur's Churachandpur district on Saturday, said, \"Manipur is a border state. Connectivity has been a challenge here. Because of paucity of good roads, people have faced problems. After 2014, I have laid emphasis that work is done on Manipur’s connectivity.\"  \"For this, we worked at two levels. We increased the budget of rail and roads. We laid stress on taking roads to both towns and villages. We have spent Rs 3,700 crore on national highways here. Another Rs 8,700 crore are being spent on new national highways. Earlier it was very difficult to reach villages. Now, roads reach 100s of villages. Hill and tribal villages have benefited with this,\" Modi told the gathering.  He also announced that the Jiribam-Imphal railway line will soon connect Imphal to the national railway network. \"The Jiribam-Imphal railway line will soon connect Imphal to national rail network. The government is spending Rs 22,000 crore on this project. Moreover, Rs 400 crore worth Imphal airport is giving new heights to air connectivity. These are also creating new employment opportunities for the youth,\" he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday addressed a public gathering in Manipur's Churachandpur district, following his interaction with people displaced due to ethnic violence over the past two years.  Referring to Manipur as the land of courage and valour, Modi said, \"I can never forget the love I received on my way to Churachandpur from Imphal by road.\"  \"This land of Manipur is a land of courage and grit. These hills are a gift of the nature. They are also a symbol of your hardwork. Because of heavy rainfall, my helicopter could not take off, so I took the road. What I saw on the roads, I thanked the Almighty that I came by road. Throughout the route, I saw Indian tricolour in the hands of the people. The vibrancy and diversity of this region is India’s strength. Manipur’s name itself has Mani (jewel). In future, this will only increase the shine of the region. We are committed to take Manipur on the road to development,\" Modi told the gathering.  \"The projects worth Rs 7,000 crore that were just inaugurated will make the lives of the people of Manipur better. These will build new facilities of health and education,\" he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday arrived in Manipur’s Churachandpur district and interacted with people displaced due to the ethnic violence at Peace Ground, news agency PTI reported quoting officials.  Modi listened to the concerns of the families of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and assured them of the Centre’s commitment to restore peace and normalcy in the state, they told PTI .  The PM also laid the foundation stone of various development works in the district.  Modi will visit the headquarters of the Kuki-Zo majority Churachandpur district, and later proceed to Imphal, the state capital located in the Meitei majority valley, at 2 pm. Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday laid the foundation stone for various development works in Manipur's Churachandpur district, news agency PTI reported.  The projects include Manipur Urban Roads, drainage and asset management improvement project worth over Rs 3,600 crore; 5 National Highway projects worth more than Rs 2,500 crore; Manipur Infotech Development (MIND) project, Working Women Hostels at 9 locations, among others, as per ANI report.   VIDEO | Manipur: PM Narendra Modi ( @narendramodi ) lays foundation stone for various development works in Churachandpur. (Source: Third Party) (Full video available on PTI Videos – https://t.co/n147TvrpG7 ) pic.twitter.com/w4uXA7URqJ  Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit comes amid a fragile calm on the ground and persistent criticism from the Opposition over what they call the government’s initial silence and hesitance in dealing with the crisis.  With Manipur still under President’s Rule and peace talks delicately balanced, Modi’s words and actions during the trip will be closely scrutinised.  For Modi, the upcoming visit carries political and symbolic weight. His absence from Manipur since the outbreak has been a persistent line of attack from the Opposition, which has accused him of “abandoning” the state in its worst crisis in decades. By travelling now, more than two years after the first clashes, the Prime Minister seeks to project a narrative of restored calm and reinforce the Centre’s role as guarantor of peace.  Here's why this visit is significant. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is currently being welcomed in Manipur's Churachandpur district as he arrives in the city by road on Saturday.  The PM will lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,300 crore at Churachandpur today. The projects include Manipur Urban Roads, drainage and asset management improvement project worth over Rs 3,600 crore; 5 National Highway projects worth more than Rs 2,500 crore; Manipur Infotech Development (MIND) project, Working Women Hostels at 9 locations, among others.

PM will lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,300 crore at Churachandpur today. The projects include Manipur Urban Roads, drainage and asset management… pic.twitter.com/i3uOB9dbCW  Owing to heavy rainfall in Manipur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Saturday flew to Imphal from Mizoram, and is currently on his way to Churchandpur via road for his event there.  His earlier plan entailed flying via helicopter from Mizoram to Churachandpur, and then travelling to Imphal. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Manipur has been welcomed by the Meiteis and the Kuki-Zo, their statements have been framed in contrasting ways.  While the Kuki-Zo have welcomed the revised Suspension of Operations (SoO) pact with Kuki militant groups signed on September 4, the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a Meitei civil society organisation, has condemned it.  Moreover,  Kuki-Zo groups have also demanded that their areas be made a Union Territory, while COCOMI has demanded a National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and the detection of illegal immigrants to correct what it sees as a “demographic imbalance”, labelling the demand for a separate administration as “ethnicisation” that can lead to “Balkanisation” or fragmentation of the region.  Here's how their demands differ.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi will reach Churachandpur in Manipur at around 11:30 am, where he will visit the headquarters of the Kuki-Zo majority Churachandpur district, and later proceed to Imphal, the state capital located in the Meitei majority valley, at 2 pm.  He is scheduled to interact with people displaced by the conflict and make public addresses, as part of which he will inaugurate and lay foundation stones for various projects. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a gathering virtually in Aizawl, hailed the work of his government in the Northeast, saying that the region is becoming the growth engine of India.  \"For a long time, some political parties in our country practised vote bank politics… The entire Northeast including states like Mizoram suffered greatly because of this attitude. But our approach is very different. Those who were earlier neglected are at the forefront now. Those who were once marginalized are the mainstream now. For the past 11 years, we have been working for the development of Northeast. This region is becoming the growth engine of India. Over the years, many states of the Northeast have been put on the rail map of India,\" he said.  \"Mizoram has a major role in both our Act East policy and the emerging north east economic corridor. With the Kaladan multi modal transit transport project and railway line, Mizoram will also get connected to the Bay of Bengal through Southeast Asia. Due to this, trade and tourism will be boosted across Northeast India and Southeast Asia,\" he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while addressing a gathering virtually in Aizawl, said, \"This is a historic day for the nation, particularly for the people of Mizoram. From today, Aizawl will be on India’s railway map. A few years ago, I had the opportunity of laying the foundation stone for the Aizawl railway line and today, we proudly dedicate it to the people of the nation. Overcoming many challenges including difficult terrain, this Bairabi-Saayirang railw line has become a reality, The skills of our engineers and the spirit of our workers make it possible.\"  \"Our hearts have always been connected with each other. Now, for the first time, Sairang in Mizoram will be connected directly to Delhi by Rajdhani Express. This is not just a railway connection. But it is a lifeline of transformation. It will revolutionaize the lives and livelihoods of the people of Mizoram,\" he said as he inaugurated the railway line. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s itinerary in Mizoram was affected by inclement weather conditions, leading him to deliver his address through video conference, and virtually inaugurate the Bairabi-Sairang Railway line from Lengpui Airport, which is around 30 km from state capital Aizawl.  Addressing a gathering virtually from the airport, Modi said, “I extend my heartfelt congratulations to you all, and welcome Aizawl to the railway map of India. Today, due to the weather, I could not come to Aizawl, but I am sure we will meet very soon.”  His next stop, Churachandpur in Imphal, where is scheduled to reach by a helicopter from Mizoram, is also experiencing rainfall.

The government is planning to rehabilitate most of the displaced people by December 2025 and subsequently close the relief camps.\n                                          | Photo Credit: RITESH SHUKLA GUWAHATI Several Meitei families displaced by ethnic violence are gearing up to return to their homes on the periphery of Manipur ’s Imphal Valley under security cover. Officials in the State’s Imphal West district said a few people had begun cleaning the houses they abandoned after the conflict between the Kuki-Zo and Meitei communities broke out on May 3, 2023, leaving more than 250 dead over two years. In some cases, the people began repairing their houses damaged or destroyed during the peak of the conflict. Their families are expected to move in after the houses are made liveable. The district authorities and security forces enabled the displaced people from a village of 21 households in New Keithelmanbi to clean and repair their houses. The village is on the boundary with the Kangpokpi district, dominated by the Kuki-Zo community. “The displaced people are being resettled in their original homes in coordination with the Deputy Commissioners of the adjoining districts. After returning home, they will continue to receive ration and benefits under the State livelihood mission,” Imphal West’s Deputy Commissioner Mayanglambam Rajkumar told journalists after inspecting a few deserted fringe villages on Tuesday. “Security will be provided to the people wherever there is a possibility of their returning home,” he said. On July 4, the State’s former Chief Secretary, Prashant Kumar Singh, said the first of a three-phase resettlement plan for the internally displaced people, chalked out in association with the Centre, was under way. He claimed that about 5,000 of some 62,000 people displaced in the violence had returned to their villages. He also said the government planned to rehabilitate most of the displaced people by December and subsequently close the relief camps, many in educational institutions. The Manipur government is expected to provide a financial assistance of ₹3.03 lakh each to the 7,000-8,000 families, whose houses were destroyed during the violence, so that they can rebuild them wherever they want. The government, however, is aware that about 10,000 Meitei people would not be able to go back to their homes in the Kuki-majority Moreh (Tengnoupal district), Kangpokpi, and Churachandpur districts. They will be given the option of staying in some 1,000 prefabricated houses being built by Manipur Police Housing Corporation Limited. A similar arrangement will be made for the Kuki-Zo people who may be unable to return to Imphal Valley.

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Manipur today, marking his first trip to the state since the outbreak of ethnic violence in 2023 that claimed more than 200 lives. For over two years, the Opposition has targeted the Prime Minister for not visiting the state to personally review the situation in the conflict-hit northeastern region. Manipur Chief Secretary Puneet Kumar Goel announced that the Prime Minister will arrive on September 13 to inaugurate development projects worth Rs 8,500 crore. PM Modi will first land in Churachandpur where he will interact with some of the internally displaced persons in the district. \"In line with his commitment to inclusive, sustainable and holistic development of Manipur, the prime minister will lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,300 crore at Churachandpur,\" he said at a press conference. \"The PM's September 13 visit to Manipur will pave the way for peace, normalcy, and growth in the state,\" he added. The Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of multiple development projects worth over Rs 7,300 crore in Churachandpur, one of the areas worst affected by the ethnic violence. The town witnessed fresh clashes on Thursday, just two days ahead of his visit, with unidentified miscreants reportedly vandalising and removing decorations prepared for the event. After the foundation-laying ceremony, PM Modi will address a public gathering before inaugurating projects worth over 1,200 crore in the state capital, Imphal. Reacting to PM's visit, Rahul Gandhi said it is not a big deal any more as the state has been in trouble for a long time. He added that the main issue is now of voter theft. \"Manipur has been in trouble for a long time and the PM has decided to go there now. So that's not a big deal. The main issue today in India is 'vote chori' (vote theft),\" said Gandhi. He added, \"The election mandates in Haryana and Maharashtra were stolen...People everywhere are saying 'Vote Chor'...\" PM MODI'S MULTI-STATE VISIT Besides Manipur, the Prime Minister will also visit other northeastern states, including Mizoram and Assam, before heading to West Bengal and poll-bound Bihar. Tomorrow, he will begin his tour in Mizoram, where he will lay the foundation stone and inaugurate multiple development projects worth over Rs 9,000 crore in Aizawl. Following this, he will travel to Manipur. Later in the evening, the Prime Minister will visit Assam to take part in the centenary celebrations of Bharat Ratna Dr. Bhupen Hazarika in Guwahati. At around 5 PM, he will also address the gathering on the occasion. On September 14, the Prime Minister will again be in Assam to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of major infrastructure and industrial development projects worth over Rs 18,530 crore. The following day, September 15, he will head to West Bengal to inaugurate the 16th Combined Commanders’ Conference-2025 in Kolkata. Thereafter, the Prime Minister will travel to Bihar, where he is scheduled to inaugurate the new terminal building of Purnea airport at around 2:45 PM. - Ends Published By: Priya Pareek Published On: Sep 12, 2025"

According to officials, a mob gathered soon after the detentions and clashed with security forces. Police used force to disperse the crowd and restore order in the area. The cutouts and banners had been put up in various parts of Churachandpur to mark the Prime Minister’s scheduled visit. Authorities said security has been tightened across the district to prevent further escalation. There was no immediate report of injuries, but the situation remained tense till late evening. PM Modi reaches Kolkata; defence chiefs, Rajnath, Doval to join key military meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kolkata on Sunday evening after a two-day tour of Northeast India. He landed at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport at 6:45 p.m., where Union Minister of State for Education and DoNER, Sukanta Majumdar, welcomed him. From the airport, Modi was greeted by enthusiastic BJP workers and supporters who lined up with drums and slogans. Responding to their welcome, the Prime Minister stopped his convoy, stepped out of his car, and waved before proceeding to Raj Bhavan, where he stayed overnight. On Monday morning, Modi will inaugurate and address the 16th Combined Commanders’ Conference-2025 at Fort William, the Eastern Command headquarters of the Indian Army. The three-day event (September 15–17), held once every two years, is the apex-level brainstorming forum of the Armed Forces. This year’s theme, “Year of Reforms – Transforming for the Future”, will guide deliberations on reforms, integration, technological modernisation, and multi-domain preparedness to strengthen India’s defence forces in a changing geo-strategic landscape. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth, Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Anil Chauhan, Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, senior ministry officials, and top officers from the three Services will attend the conference. Both Rajnath Singh and Ajit Doval also reached Kolkata on Sunday evening. According to the schedule, Modi will visit Vijay Durg in Fort William at 9:30 a.m. to attend the session, which will continue until around 1 p.m. He is expected to leave for Bihar in the afternoon. In view of the visit, Kolkata Police issued traffic restrictions for September 15–16. Goods vehicles have been barred from key routes—including VIP Road, EM Bypass, Maa Flyover, AJC Bose Road, Red Road, and areas around Raj Bhavan—during designated hours to ensure smooth movement of the Prime Minister’s convoy. PM Modi arrives in Kolkata, to inaugurate Combined Commanders’ Conference tomorrow Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kolkata to a warm welcome from supporters and party workers who gathered along the route to greet him. During his visit, Modi will inaugurate the 16th Combined Commanders’ Conference-2025 in the city on Monday. The high-level conference will bring together top military leadership to review national security challenges, operational preparedness, and future strategies. The Prime Minister’s arrival saw tight security arrangements across Kolkata, with heavy deployment of police and paramilitary forces to manage the crowds and ensure smooth movement of the cavalcade. Local BJP leaders and workers expressed enthusiasm over the visit, highlighting the significance of Kolkata hosting the prestigious defence conference. PM Modi gets rousing reception at Golaghat roadshow Prime Minister Narendra Modi was accorded a warm welcome during his roadshow in Golaghat, as people lined the streets to greet him with chants and tricolours. Supporters gathered in large numbers along the route, waving party flags and showering flowers as the Prime Minister’s cavalcade passed by. Many were seen capturing the moment on their phones, while local groups performed traditional dances to mark the occasion. The roadshow comes as part of Modi’s visit to Assam, where he is scheduled to address public meetings and inaugurate key development projects. Security was heightened across the district, with heavy deployment of police and paramilitary forces to ensure smooth conduct of the event. PM Modi: Assam to play key role in India’s Semiconductor Mission Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Assam will be a central hub in India’s push for self-reliance under the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign, announcing that the state has been chosen for a major semiconductor initiative. “Today, our country is demonstrating the pinnacle of hard work for the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign. Assam is one of the key centres of this campaign. I have full confidence in Assam's potential, which is why we have chosen Assam for a very large campaign, and that campaign is the Semiconductor Mission,” Modi said while addressing a gathering in the state. He also linked Assam’s future role in high-tech manufacturing with its historical success in creating global value. “During the era of slavery, Assam tea did not have that much recognition, but in no time, Assam's soil and the people of Assam turned Assam tea into a global brand,” Modi said. According to the Prime Minister, the state’s natural resources, skilled manpower, and entrepreneurial spirit will drive its transformation into a technology and manufacturing hub under the new mission. PM Modi: From banning bamboo to making ethanol, Assam leading new growth story Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Assam and the Northeast are witnessing a new phase of growth as the government pushes forward projects that link local resources with national development. Speaking at an event in Assam, Modi recalled how bamboo, a vital part of tribal life, was once restricted under Congress rule. “Today, we are going to make ethanol from bamboo. But you should not forget the days when the Congress government used to put people in jail for cutting bamboo. There was a ban on cutting bamboo, which is a part of the daily life of our tribals. Our government lifted the ban on bamboo cutting and today this decision is benefiting the people of North East a lot,” he said. Modi also highlighted the launch of a new polypropylene plant, stressing its importance in everyday life. “All of you use many things made of plastic in your daily life. The thing needed to make all this is polypropylene. It is difficult to imagine today's life without polypropylene... The foundation of Make in Assam, Make in India, is going to be strengthened with this plant. Other manufacturing industries will also get a boost here,” he said. He added that textiles made from polypropylene will soon become part of Assam’s identity, further boosting the state’s manufacturing sector. ‘Nagrik Devo Bhava’: PM Modi highlights BJP’s development mantra in Assam Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the BJP government is committed to ensuring that citizens do not face inconvenience in their daily lives, stressing that the party’s development mantra is rooted in the principle of “Nagrik Devo Bhava”. Addressing a gathering in Assam, Modi contrasted the BJP’s approach with that of the Congress, alleging that the latter’s policies during its rule were guided by appeasement of a particular section, leaving the poor neglected. “For a long time during the rule of Congress, the poor were made to suffer and were insulted, because the work of Congress was done by appeasing a particular class. They used to get power. But the BJP does not emphasise on appeasement, but satisfaction,” the Prime Minister said. Modi underlined that the BJP government’s efforts are aimed at inclusive growth. “We are working with the feeling that no poor, no area, should be left behind,” he noted. On the progress of welfare schemes in Assam, the Prime Minister said construction of concrete houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana was moving rapidly in the state. “So far, more than 20 lakh concrete houses have been provided to the poor in Assam,” he said. PM Modi targets Congress over ‘infiltration’, praises Assam govt’s Mission Basundhara Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharpened his attack on the Congress, accusing it of encouraging infiltration and altering Assam’s demography for vote-bank politics. Speaking at a rally in Golaghat, Modi said the issue of infiltration has become a growing challenge for the state. “When the Congress government was here, it gave land to the infiltrators and gave protection to illegal occupation. Congress disturbed the balance of Assam's demography in the greed of vote bank. Now the BJP government is fighting this challenge along with the people of Assam,” he said. The Prime Minister also praised the state government’s land reform initiative, Mission Basundhara, which has provided land leases to lakhs of families. “I would also like to praise the Assam government for Mission Basundhara. Under this, land leases have been given to lakhs of families… BJP is fully committed to correct the historical injustice done to the tribal society,” he added. Modi’s remarks came as part of a broader pitch linking development projects with efforts to safeguard the rights of locals and tribal communities in Assam. PM Modi inaugurates bamboo-based ethanol plant in Assam, promises boost for farmers Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a bamboo-based ethanol plant in Assam, calling it a step towards India’s green energy transition and a source of livelihood for local farmers. Highlighting the need for alternatives to oil and gas, Modi said ethanol will play a crucial role in the country’s energy strategy. “In these changing times, India needs more fuels as an alternative to oil and gas. One such alternative is ethanol. Today, a plant to make ethanol from bamboo has been started here. This will be of great benefit to the farmers of Assam, my tribal brothers, sisters and families,” he said. The Prime Minister underlined that the plant would not only promote clean energy but also generate employment. He announced that about Rs 200 crore will be spent annually in the area to support bamboo cultivation and procurement. “The bamboo required to run the bio-ethanol plant is also being arranged. The government will help the farmers here to cultivate bamboo and will also purchase bamboo. Thousands of people here will benefit from this one plant,” he added. Modi also noted India’s rapid progress in renewable energy, pointing out that the country has moved from lagging behind to being among the top five nations in solar power globally. PM Modi announces National Deepwater Exploration Mission, stresses self-reliance in energy Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India is moving firmly towards self-reliance in energy, announcing the launch of a National Deepwater Exploration Mission to tap potential reserves of oil and gas in the country’s seas. Speaking at a public gathering in Golaghat, Modi said India’s growing economy has sharply increased the demand for electricity, fuel, and natural gas. “We import huge quantities of crude oil and gas from foreign countries, and in return, India has to give lakhs of crores of rupees to other countries every year. Our money creates jobs abroad. The income of the people there increases. It was necessary to change this situation,” he said. The Prime Minister underlined that India is taking a dual approach, discovering new domestic reserves of crude and gas while also investing in green energy. Referring to his Independence Day announcement of Samudra Manthan, he added, “Experts say there can be huge reserves of oil and gas in our seas too. We are going to start the National Deepwater Exploration Mission so that these resources can be useful for the country.” The initiative, he said, would reduce dependence on imports, save foreign exchange, and create jobs within India, aligning with his vision of a self-reliant energy sector. PM Modi unveils projects worth Rs 18,000 crore in Assam, calls it step towards 'Viksit Bharat' Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced development projects worth about Rs 18,000 crore in Assam, calling it a landmark moment in the state’s journey towards a “developed Assam, developed India.” Addressing a public gathering in Golaghat, PM Modi said, “I have been in the North East for the last two days. Whenever I come to the North East, I get unprecedented love and blessings. Especially the love and affection I get in this region of Assam is amazing. I express my heartfelt gratitude to all of you.” The Prime Minister underlined the importance of the investments, saying the projects would strengthen infrastructure, create jobs, and accelerate economic growth in the region. While the details of the projects were not immediately specified, officials said they span key sectors including energy, transport, and connectivity. PM Modi also linked the announcement to his broader vision of a “Viksit Bharat” (Developed India), stressing that development in Assam and the Northeast was central to the country’s overall growth. The visit comes as the Centre continues to push its “Act East” policy, aimed at improving connectivity and trade links between India’s Northeast and Southeast Asia.

These advancements are transforming lives and driving business growth, paving the way for a brighter future,\" he said.

You people tell me, is my decision of honouring Bhupen Da with Bharat Ratna right or wrong? Is the insult done by the Congress party for honouring him with Bharat Ratna right or wrong?\" he further said. 'I have put forth the idea of ​​a Sudarshan Chakra in the future security policy before the people,' says PM Modi in Assam \"Yesterday was my first visit to Assam after Operation Sindoor.

He is scheduled to lay foundation stones at Darrang, address a public gathering, inaugurate the Assam Bio-ethanol Private Limited and the Numaligarh Refinery Plant in Golaghat, and lay the foundation for a new polypropylene plant there. Modi in Assam: Bhupen Hazarika was a champion of India’s unity, says PM PM Modi Saturday paid tribute to legendary singer and Bharat Ratna recipient Bhupen Hazarika during his birth centenary celebrations in Guwahati and said Bhupen da kept giving voice to the unity of India even during the difficult times when North-East was “left to burn in the fire of violence and separatism.” Hailing Bhupen Hazarika as a great champion of India’s unity and integrity, the Prime Minister stressed that govt is working to realise his dreams of a prosperous North-East. “Bhupen da was a great champion of India’s unity and integrity. Decades ago, when the North-East was a victim of neglect, North-East was left to burn in the fire of violence and separatism, Bhupen da kept giving voice to the unity of India even in those difficult times. He dreamt of a prosperous North-East. He sang songs for the North-East. He sang songs for Assam. Today, we are working day and night to realise his dreams for the NorthEast,” PM said. “Just a few days ago, on Sept 8, on the occassion of Bhupen Hazarika’s birthday, I expressed my feelings in an article dedicated to Bhupen da. It is my good fortune that I have got the opportunity to participate in this event of his birth centenary. (Assam CM) Himanta was saying I have done a favour by coming here. On the contrary, it is my good fortune to come on such a holy occasion,” PM said. PM Modi also shared that people used to lovingly call Bhupen da ‘Sudha Kontho,” he added that even though “Bhupen da is no longer physically present among us, but his songs, his voice, are still witnessing India’s development journey, giving it energy. Our govt is celebrating Bhupen da’s birth centenary year with great pride.” PM Modi also spoke about Operation Sindoor, reiterating that the new India will not compromise on its security and self-respect at any cost. “The country gave such a reply to Pakistan’s terrorist designs that the echo of India’s strength has reached the whole world. We have shown that India’s enemy will not be safe in any corner. New India will not compromise on its security and self-respect at any cost,” the PM said. PM Modi didn’t present any solution, visit a mere pit stop: Congress Congress dubbed PM Modi’s first visit to Manipur since it witnessed ethnic conflict two and half years ago as “tokenism” and a “grave insult to a wounded people”. It called his failure to visit earlier as emblematic of lack of compassion in his politics and leadership, and asked him “where is your rajdharma”. Calling it a “pit stop” of less than five hours after a wait of 2.5 years, AICC chief Mallikarjun Kharge accused Modi of “cowardly” escaping from hearing the cries of people in relief camps. “Eight hundred and sixty four days of violence, 300 lives lost, 67,000 displaced, 1,500 plus injured. You made 46 foreign trips since, but not a single visit to share two words of sympathy with your own citizens.” He added, “Your and home minister Amit Shah’s gross incompetence and complicity in betraying all communities was shielded from scrutiny by the imposition of President’s rule in the state. Violence still continues.” “This hush-hush pit stop isn’t repentance. It’s not even guilt … It is a cruel prick to the wounds of those still suffering because of your own abdication of basic constitutional responsibilities.” Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said the “face saving farce” did not present any solution to address the social rift that caused the “civil war” nor the courage to bring together the warring factions for peace. “Such a tone deaf, insensitive and self-aggrandising stunt is nothing but a mockery of people of Manipur … one is left to wonder whether those who peddle hate every single day can ever be messengers of peace,” he asked. Build bridges of harmony between hills and valley: Prime Minister Modi in Manipur Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday made a personal outreach to the people of Manipur, a state torn apart by ethnic strife, urging them to “build bridges of harmony between the hills and the valley”, and backed it with the unveiling of projects worth Rs 8,500 crore, aimed at rebuilding infrastructure and restoring hope. Modi’s message was clear, a reconciliation must replace resentment, and development must bridge the divide. “Govt of Bharat is making every possible effort to restore normalcy in Manipur. Today, I assure you, I am with you, the Govt of Bharat is with the people of Manipur,” Modi said. Our North East is the land of new light and new hope for the nation, says PM Modi \"The history, culture and divine aura of the North East, along with the sacrifices of its people for the honour and pride of Bharat Mata, are inseparable from the idea of India itself. Our North East is the land of new light and new hope for the nation. After all, the first sunrise of the country takes place here. Bhupen Da gave voice to this very spirit through his songs,\" he said. 'Even in those difficult times, he (Bhupen Hazarika) dreamt of a prosperous North East,' says PM Modi \"Bhupen Da was a great champion of India’s unity and integrity. Decades ago, when the North East faced neglect and when it was left to burn in the fire of violence and separatism, Bhupen Da continued to raise his voice for India’s unity. Even in those difficult times, he dreamt of a prosperous North East,\" said PM Modi. We are carrying Bhupen Hazarika’s songs, his messages, and the journey of his life to every household, says PM Modi \"Our government takes immense pride in celebrating the 100th birth anniversary of Bhupen Da. We are carrying Bhupen Hazarika’s songs, his messages, and the journey of his life to every household. On this occasion, his biography has also been released. I bow in reverence to Dr Bhupen Hazarika and extend my heartfelt greetings on his birth anniversary to every Indian, along with my brothers and sisters of Assam,\" says PM Modi. I wholeheartedly appreciate all the artists who have been a part of this event, says PM Modi \"Today is a remarkable day, and these moments are truly priceless. The sight I witnessed here, the spirit and harmony I felt, and the glimpse of Bhupen’s music that I experienced made me wish this wave of Bhupen’s melodies would keep flowing forever. I wholeheartedly appreciate all the artists who have been a part of this event,\" says PM Modi. We all used to lovingly call Bhupen da 'Sudha Kontho': PM Modi \"Just a few days ago, on 8th September, on the occassion of Bhupen Hazarika's birthday, I expressed my feelings in an article dedicated to Bhupen da. It is my good fortune that I have got the opportunity to participate in this event of his birth centenary year. Just now, (CM) Hemanta was saying that I have done a favour by coming here. On the contrary, it is my good fortune to come on such a holy occasion. We all used to lovingly call Bhupen da 'Sudha Kontho'.

'We must not allow their (Manipur youth) identity to be overshadowed by the dark shadow of violence,' says PM Modi In 2014, I had said that Indian culture is incomplete without Manipuri culture, and Indian sports are incomplete without the athletes of Manipur. The youth of Manipur are those who dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the honour of the tricolour. We must not allow their identity to be overshadowed by the dark shadow of violence, says PM Modi. PM Modi congratulates Nepal's Sushila Karki for taking oath as interim Prime Minister \"Today, from this land of Manipur, I also wish to speak to my brothers and sisters in Nepal. Nestled in the lap of the Himalayas, Nepal is a true friend of India. We are bound by shared history and faith, and we are moving forward together. On behalf of 140 crore Indians, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Mrs. Sushila Ji on assuming office as the Interim Prime Minister of Nepal. I am confident that she will pave the way for peace, stability, and prosperity in Nepal,\" says PM Modi.

It was on this very soil that the Indian National Army unfurled India’s first tricolour. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose described Manipur as the gateway to India’s independence. This land has given the nation many brave martyrs. Our government is moving forward with inspiration drawn from every such great personality of Manipur,\" says PM Modi. PM Modi pays tribute to Manipur's Deepak Chingakham, who made supreme sacrifice during Operation Sindoor \"Many children of Manipur are engaged in protecting Mother India in different parts of the country.

The valour of many brave sons and daughters of Manipur is also included in this success of India,\" said PM Modi. \"Similarly, I salute the valour of our brave martyr Deepak Chingakham. The country will always remember his sacrifice during Operation Sindoor. I had said that Indian culture is incomplete without Manipuri culture. And without the players of Manipur, the sports of India are also incomplete. The youth of Manipur is a youth who gives his whole heart and soul for the pride of the tricolour,\" he further said. 'Manipur is the crown jewel adorning the crown of Mother India,' says PM Modi \"Manipur is the crown jewel adorning the crown of Mother India. That is why we must continuously strengthen Manipur’s image as a land of progress. Any form of violence in Manipur is unfortunate. Such violence is a grave injustice not only to our ancestors but also to our future generations. Therefore, we must keep taking Manipur forward on the path of peace and development, together,\" PM Modi said. Our government is making every effort, with full sensitivity, to ease the difficulties of your lives, says PM Modi \"Many people from Manipur frequently travel to Kolkata and Delhi. To provide affordable accommodation, Manipur Bhavans have been built in both cities. These Bhavans will be of great help, especially to the daughters of Manipur. When children stay there safely and comfortably, the worries of their parents here will be greatly reduced.

'I consider women’s power to be the driving force of India’s development,' says PM Modi in Imphal \"Manipur is that state of India where mothers and sisters have always been at the forefront of the economy. The tradition of Ima Keithel is a shining example of this. I consider women’s power to be the driving force of India’s development and self-reliance, and here in Manipur we see its true inspiration. After our government was formed, we began constructing special haat bazaars and Ima markets for women,\" said PM Modi. \"I am happy that today four new Ima markets have been inaugurated. These markets will provide greater opportunities and support for the women of Manipur,\" he added. Now this time of the 21st century is the time of the North East, says PM Modi at Imphal public meet \"The Government of India has continuously given priority to the development of Manipur. As a result, the development rate of Manipur is constantly increasing. Before 2014, the development rate of Manipur was less than one per cent. Now, Manipur is progressing many times faster than before. A new era of infrastructure development has begun in Manipur. The pace of building roads and national highways in Manipur has also increased many times. Work is also being done at a fast pace to reach every village here,\" says PM Narendra Modi.

        "content": "The Supreme Court Monday sought a sealed-cover report from the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory, which is examining the “leaked audio tapes” that, according to a Kuki body, established Manipur CM N Biren Singh’s role in fuelling ethnic conflict in the state. A bench of Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Sanjay Kumar directed Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for Manipur, that the report be produced before it on the next date of hearing on March 24. The petitioner, Kuki Organization for Human Rights Trust, has sought an independent investigation based on the tapes into Biren’s alleged role in the violence, which has killed more than 200 people in Manipur since May 2023. The Manipur government has termed the clips as fake and said that they were released on social media in an attempt to derail peace initiatives. “It is pointed out that audio clips have been sent for examination by the CFSL. The report would be produced in sealed cover before the court on the next date of hearing,” the court directed. At the very outset, CJI Khanna told Advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for the petitioner, “There are two things. One — the state is gradually limping back to normalcy. We will keep it on hold. The second issue is whether we should entertain it or the High Court should entertain it.” Bhushan said the transcripts of the tapes were “very serious” and implicated the CM. The CJI said he had not gone through the transcripts. Bhushan said the petitioner had sent the tapes to Truth Labs which has “far more expertise and credibility than CFSL…” and that the lab had said it was “his (Biren’s) voice” in the tapes. SG Mehta pointed out that Truth Labs was run by private individuals. He said the “petitioner has some ideological inclinations” and that the court-appointed committee of former judges has filed reports saying “these civil society organisations are wanting to keep the pot boiling… That appears to be the intention. Let that not happen.” Mehta was referring to the Justice Gita Mittal Committee, which was constituted by the SC last August to address the humanitarian concerns stemming from the violence. Mehta said an FIR had already been lodged in August and the petition was filed in November: “My objection is not delay only but we said that whatever they have supplied has been sent to CFSL and a report is awaited. Whoever has uploaded on their Twitter (X) account, we have approached them also (asking) if you have the original, please give it to us so that (its veracity can be checked).” The CJI said, “We are careful. That’s why I said in the beginning itself. This should not become another issue.” “At the same time, I don’t know the contents of the transcripts, and the veracity also. That’s for you people to examine… Let the FSL report come,” the CJI added. Meanwhile, the SC made it clear that the state’s objection as to why the petitioner could not have approached the HC will remain open and Monday’s order will have no bearing on it.

The programme at the Kangla Fort complex in Imphal was part of his first trip to the state after ethnic violence broke out between Meiteis and the Kuki community in May 2023. The Prime Minister inaugurated the new Manipur Police headquarters at Mantripukhri, built at a cost of ₹101 crore, and the civil secretariat, constructed at ₹538 crore in the same locality.

Holding placards, the workers of the Manipur Peoples’ Party Youth Front raised slogans outside its office here and claimed that the PM’s visit is “not aimed at restoration of peace and normalcy” in the state. The MPP office is close to the Kangla Fort, where the prime minister is scheduled to inaugurate a slew of development projects and hold a public rally. A similar protest by the Congress youth wing activists was also staged in front of the Congress Bhavan, around 100 metres from the PM’s function venue. Protesters were prevented by police personnel from proceeding to the PM’s programme venue. Meanwhile, braving rains and waterlogging in different parts of the state capital, thousands of people from various parts of the Imphal valley turned up at the Kangla Fort to attend Modi’s public address. -- PTI Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla on Saturday (September 13, 2025) urged the people of Churachandpur not to allow illegal settlements of “people beyond the borders”, asserting that the government was committed to taking effective steps to address this challenge. Addressing a public meeting in Churachandpur, from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled development projects worth ₹7,300 crore, Mr. Bhalla said he was confident that Manipur will emerge more resilient, united and prosperous. “We cannot allow our land to be encroached by people from beyond the borders. Both the state and the Centre are committed to taking effective steps to address this challenge,” he said. Mr. Bhalla said a three-phase resettlement plan has been formulated to rehabilitate those displaced by the ethnic violence in the State. “A three-phase resettlement plan for IDPs (internally displaced persons) has been taken up to settle them at the earliest. Additional security personnel and QRTs have been deployed to bolster further safety and stability. PM Modi is your light of hope,” he said. The governor said Churachandpur is not just a geographical location but a land of rich cultural diversity and resilience. “The focus on connectivity, infrastructure, education and health care has brought hope and new opportunities to our youths. Today, as we look forward, we also acknowledge the challenges that we must face together, challenges of peace, development and trust,” he added. Mr. Bhalla said taking development to the remotest corner of the country is the cornerstone of the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ or developed India. “It is the time to heal and look forward with dialogue, understanding and inclusive governance. I am confident that Manipur will emerge more resilient, more united and prosperous. We must all contribute to bring peace to our society,” he said. “Churachandpur district has been the top priority of the State. Being a border district, the government is committed to providing connectivity and essential infrastructure,” he said. -- PTI When Prime Minister Modi landed at the airport in Imphal, it was raining heavily. It was said that the weather was not conducive for helicopter travel to Churachandpur. The rally venue was about 1.5 hours away by road. Despite heavy rain, Mr. Modi decided that he would reach the rally venue by road, no matter how much time it took, just so that he could interact with the people. On women’s development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said “For IDPs, ₹500 crore special provision has been made. Mr. Modi said “I now about the aspirations and struggles of our tribal youth. We are trying to address them. We are trying to strengthen the autonomous local bodies.” He said “Manipur’s culture promotes women’s strength. We are building working women’s hostel for Manipuri women.” The Prime Minister reiterated that “We want to make Manipur a symbol of peace and prosperity.” He said “To rehabilitate the Internally displaced people and to bring peace, the government of India will keep helping Manipur Government.” Prime Minister Modi visits Manipur to promote dialogue and peace, inaugurating projects and addressing ethnic conflict aftermath. Talking about the violence that affected Manipur, PM Modi urged ‘peace of paramount for development’ in the State. The Prime Minister earlier met people affected by the violence and who were internally displaced. “A start has been made for peace talks with groups in valley and hills,” PM Modi said. Urging the people to bring peace in Manipur, Mr. Modi said, “I appeal to all organisations to fulfill their dreams by walking on the path of peace, secure the future of your children. I am with you, Government of India is with you. To bring back life on tracks in Manipur, GOI is making all efforts. Those rendered homeless, we are giving aid to build 7,000 homes.” “The name Manipur itself has ‘Mani’, a gem that will enhance the shine of the entire Northeast in the coming times. A while ago, from this very platform, the foundation stone for projects worth around Rs 7,000 crore was laid. These projects will improve the lives of people, especially the tribal communities living in the hills of Manipur. They will provide new facilities in health and education for you all,” Prime Minister Modi said in Churachandpur. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after laying the foundation stone for various development works in Churachandpur, says, “The land of Manipur is the land of courage and determination. These hills are a priceless gift of nature, and at the same time, they symbolise your continuous hard work. I salute the spirit of the people of Manipur.” “Centre is committed to bring development here. Over ₹7000 crore project inaugurated. This will better the lives of people of Manipur and those living in the hills,” he said. “Manipur is a State with international border. Connectivity has been an issue here. Am aware of the problems faced due to poor roads. After 2014, I worked on Manipur’s connectivity. We have increased the budget for rail and road in Manipur and stressed on improving road connectivity,” Mr. Modi said. Prime Minister took a long road journey to reach Churachandpur. This place is a symbol of diversity, resilience, Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla said. Today we face Challenges of peace, development and trust. Today is the time to heal and move forward with dialogue and inclusivity, he said. Churachandpur is one of the top priorities of the State. Being a border State our duty to provide development here. We cannot afford our land to be encroached and inhabited by people from across the border. State and Centre will have to address these challenges, Mr. Bhalla added. Your presence is a ray of hope and is a symbol of Centre’s initiatives for development, he added. In view of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit, security has been tightened in Manipur. Both State and central forces’ personnel were deployed in large numbers in and around the nearly 237-acre Kangla Fort in Imphal and the Peace Ground in Churachandpur, the venues of the Prime Minister’s rallies. Heavy rain has lashed the State since Friday (September 12, 2025) night, resulting in ankle-deep water in parts of the Kangla Fort. The PM’s visit comes amid repeated criticism by opposition parties for not visiting Manipur following the ethnic strife between the Kuki and Meitei communities, which has left over 260 people dead and thousands homeless. -- PTI Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives at Peace Ground, Churachandpur. Mr. Modi is meeting the internally displaced people. Mr. Modi will be laying foundation stones for projects worth over ₹7,300 crore. -- Vijaita Singh In his X post, the Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge asked “Narendra Modi ji, your 3-hour pit stop in Manipur is not compassion — it’s farce, tokenism, and a grave insult to wounded people. Your so-called roadshow in Imphal and Churachandpur today, is nothing but a cowardly escape from hearing the cries of people in relief camps!” “864 days of violence:-- 300 lives lost, 67,000 displaced, 1,500 plus injured. You made 46 foreign trips since, but not a single visit to share two words of sympathy with your own citizens,” Kharge said. “Your last visit to Manipur? January 2022 — for elections! Your ‘Double Engine’ has bulldozed the innocent lives of Manipur. You and Home Minister Amit Shah’s gross incompetence and complicity in betraying all communities was shielded from scrutiny, by imposing President’s Rule in the state. Violence still continues,” he said. It is the BJP which was responsible for maintaining law and order in the state and it is now the Union government which is again dithering, he claimed. “Not to forget, that is your government which is responsible for National Security and border patrol. This hush-hush pit stop isn’t repentance. It’s not even guilt. You are organising a grand welcome ceremony for yourself. It is a cruel prick to the wounds of those still suffering because of your own abdication of basic constitutional responsibilities!” Mr. Kharge said. Congress president Kharge criticizes Modi's Manipur visit as a grand welcome ceremony, calling it a cruel insult to suffering citizens. Terming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Manipur a “pit stop”, the Congress on Saturday (September 13, 2025) alleged that the trip is “tokenism” and a “grave insult” to the people of the state. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge accused Modi of organising a grand welcome ceremony for himself and claimed that it “is a cruel prick” to the wounds of those still suffering. “In the words of your own... Where is your Rajdharma?” Mr. Kharge asked on X just before the start of Modi’s Manipur visit.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with internally displaced people in Churachandpur and Imphal during his visit to Manipur. The visit comes over two years after deadly ethnic violence between Kuki and Meitei communities left over 260 dead and thousands homeless. The Hindu Deputy Editor Vijaita Singh reports on the ongoing situation and the political context surrounding Modi’s visit. Congress leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, on Friday (September 12, 2025) downplayed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled visit to Manipur, asserting that the Prime Minister’s trip to the strife-torn State is “not a big deal” and that the central issue facing the country is “vote chori” (vote theft). Rahul Gandhi criticizes PM Modi's visit to Manipur, emphasizing \"vote chori\" as the main issue in India. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to visit Manipur on Saturday (September 12, 2025), his first since ethnic violence erupted in the State in May 2023, Imphal and Churachandpur, the two places where he is expected to lead a roadshow and address a gathering of thousands of people, are fortified with heavy security presence every 100 metres. Though the visit was being planned for days, as reported by The Hindu on September 2, it was officially announced by the Prime Minister’s Office and the State administration only on Friday (September 11, 2025). PM Modi to visit Manipur, inaugurate projects worth ₹8,500 crore, address ethnic violence aftermath, amid heavy security presence.

November 13, 2025 e-Paper Published - April 17, 2025 01:17 pm IST - New Delhi Former Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh.\n                                          | Photo Credit: PTI The Centre on Thursday (April 17, 2025) informed the Supreme Court that a forensic report on the authenticity of leaked audio clips alleging the role of former Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren Singh in the ethnic violence in the State was ready and would be filed shortly in a sealed cover. A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sanjiv Khanna took note of the submissions of a counsel appearing for the Centre and the State government to this effect and deferred the hearing on a plea filed by the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust (KOHUR) in the week commencing May 5. The counsel said the report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) will be filed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and sought an adjournment, saying the law officer was unavailable at the moment. Mr. Singh resigned as the chief minister of Manipur on February 9, amid rumblings within the State BJP and growing demands for a change of leadership. ALSO WATCH Biren Singh quits as Manipur CM after meeting Home Minister Shah Earlier, the top court sought a sealed-cover forensic report from the CFSL on the authenticity of the leaked audio clips alleging Mr. Singh's role in the ethnic violence that began in May 2023. KOHUR, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, had sought a court-monitored SIT probe into Mr. Singh's alleged role. \"The state is gradually limping back to normalcy and we will keep it (the matter) on hold at the moment,\" the CJI had said, adding he would see later whether the top court or the high court should hear the case. The solicitor general agreed with the observations. Also read | After news report on alleged voice clips of CM, Manipur govt. calls it ‘anti-national’ activity Mr. Bhushan termed the contents of the audio leaks a \"very serious matter\" and said Mr. Singh was purportedly heard saying that Meitei groups were allowed to loot arms and ammunition of the State government. \"I have annexed transcripts of tape recordings,\" he added. The solicitor general said the petitioner had \"ideological inclinations\" and there was a report by a committee of three high court judges which stated that there were efforts to keep the \"pot boiling\". “A truth lab confirmed that 93% it is the voice of the chief minister,” said Mr. Bhushan, “and truth labs are far more reliable than the FSL reports.” The law officer, however, questioned the veracity of the truth lab report. On November 8 last year, a Bench headed by former CJI D.Y. Chandrachud directed KOHUR to produce material to indicate the authenticity of some of the leaked audio clips. Mr. Bhushan had said he would also file a copy of the tape in a CD format. S-G Mehta, however, said the plea could be filed in the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution. More than 260 people have been killed and thousands displaced since the ethnic violence broke out between the Imphal valley-based Meitei and neighbouring hills-based Kuki communities in May 2023. The clashes began after a 'Tribal Solidarity March' was organised in the hill districts to protest against an order of the Manipur High Court on the Meitei community's demand for Scheduled Tribe status. Mr. Bhushan alleged that the recorded conversation prima facie showed the complicity and involvement of the State machinery in the violence against the Kuki Zo community. He said the clips had \"disturbing conversations\" and Mr. Singh could be heard instigating the violence and protecting the attackers. KOHUR's plea alleged that Mr. Singh was instrumental in \"inciting, organising and thereafter centrally orchestrating the large-scale murder, destruction and other forms of violence against the Kuki-dominated areas in Manipur\". \"Petitioner is praying for a court-monitored investigation by special investigation team into the leaked audio tape clips as there is clear and strong prima facie evidence showing involvement of the highest functionary, i.e., chief minister of a State. The investigation would need to unearth the conspiracy which appears to involve the highest functionary of state,\" it said.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report on the examination of certain leaked audio tapes which allegedly implicate Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh for instigating ethnic violence in the state. A bench of Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Sanjay Kumar said the CFSL report should be submitted in six weeks in a sealed cover. The bench then posted the hearing in the week commencing on March 24. \"Relist in the week commencing on March 24, 2025. It is pointed out that audio clips are sent for examination by CFSL. The report will be produced in sealed cover,\" the bench stated in its order. The order of the top court came on a petition filed by the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust seeking an independent investigation into the audio tapes. During the hearing, Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Manipur government, alleged that the petitioner was carrying certain \"ideological baggage\" with a \"separatist mindset.\" Mehta said that even the judges' panel constituted by the Supreme Court has raised concerns about certain civil society organisations wanting to \"keep the pot boiling.\" CJI said he has not gone into the contents and veracity of the audio tapes and sought report by CFSL. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench that the audio tapes were examined by 'Truth Labs', a private forensic science laboratory, which certified that the voice belongs to the Chief Minister by over 93 per cent. The report of the 'Truth Labs,' carries more credibility than any government agencies' report, he said. The plea filed by a Kuki group organisation sought a court-monitored investigation into the alleged audio clips. The Kuki group claimed that it had audio tapes shared by a whistle-blower of telephone conversations held by the Chief Minister \"establishing complicity of the highest functionary and others in ethnic violence in the state of Manipur.\" The top court is also seized of the cases relating to the violence in Manipur between Meitei and Kuki communities. The violence in Manipur between the Hindu Meiteis and the tribal Kuki, who are Christians, erupted after a rally by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur (ATSUM) on May 3, 2023. Violence has gripped the entire state since May 2023 and both the Central and state governments led by BJP, have come under fire for failing to stop it.

        "content": "Subscribe Now! Get features like A media team en route to cover the opening ceremony of the 5th Shirui Lily Festival in Manipur was forced to return after personnel of the MAHAR Regiment and Border Security Force (BSF) allegedly blocked their bus at Gwaltabi in Imphal East district. The incident occurred on Tuesday morning, the day when the five-day festival is scheduled to commence in Ukhrul district. The festival is being held for the first time since ethnic violence erupted in the state in May 2023. On May 8, Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla chaired the second organising committee meeting for the festival at Raj Bhavan in Imphal, where key issues including budget allocation, scheduling, security, transport logistics, crowd management, accommodation, cultural programming, and promotional strategies were discussed. As part of logistical arrangements, the Manipur State Transport (MST) had issued a notice on May 6 announcing dedicated bus services from Imphal to Ukhrul between May 20 and 24. Three buses were to operate between the Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT), Imphal, and Shirui Public Ground, Ukhrul, at a fare of ₹ 200 per passenger. According to an order issued by the Director of Information and Public Relations (DIPR), Manipur, on May 19, a dedicated transport service for media personnel covering the festival was arranged from the DIPR office at Nityaipat Chuthek, Imphal. Security on National Highway 202, which connects Imphal East to Ukhrul, has been handed over to BSF and Army personnel ahead of the festival. Although Ukhrul is a Naga-dominated district that remained largely unaffected by the ethnic conflict, a heavy security presence was deemed necessary since Meitei attendees would have to travel through six Kuki-Zo villages Mongneljang, Gwaltabi, Zalenbung, Mongot-Chepu, Litan, and Sareikhong located along the route. Two other villages, Thawai Kuki and Zaolen, are situated nearby. In a public notice issued on Monday, Ukhrul additional deputy commissioner Polly Makan advised all travellers to use the Yaingangpokpi route between 8am and 4pm. “Visitors travelling after 4pm will be escorted by security personnel,” and noted that “no movement will be permitted after midnight to ensure safety and order,” she said. When contacted, members of the media team claimed that they were being stopped at multiple checkpoints between Imphal and Ukhrul. “When we reached near Gwaltabi, Imphal East, the BSF personnel told us to remove the ‘Manipur State Transport’ signage from the bus. We covered the MST markings with paper, but later, another team from the MAHAR Regiment arrived and said the bus could not proceed further,” a member of the media team said. “We were scheduled to cover the festival’s inaugural function at 11am. If we are detained until 10am, how are we supposed to report on the event? We were not going to Ukhrul to have lunch...we were on assignment,” the journalist added. Eventually, the team hired a private vehicle and returned to Imphal. The other MST buses were also made to spray-paint on the ‘Manipur State Transport’ signage and were then allowed to proceed. Earlier, on March 8, the MST had resumed services following instructions from Union home minister Amit Shah, allowing free movement across all roads in Manipur. However, buses were attacked in Kangpokpi district by Kuki-Zo protesters demanding the suspension of MST services in their dominated areas until their demand for a separate administration, specifically a Union Territory, is fulfilled.   Media team blocked by MAHAR Regiment and BSF while traveling to Shirui Lily Festival in Manipur, forcing them to return. Festival begins amid heightened security tensions, with checkpoints and restrictions on travel routes between Imphal and Ukhrul districts."

October 21, 2025 e-Paper Updated - June 21, 2025 07:08 am IST - GUWAHATI Search operations were conducted by security forces in the fringe and vulnerable areas of hill and valley districts in Manipur. During the operation, arms and ammunition were recovered. Photo: X/@manipur_police Two districts of Manipur remained tense on Friday (June 20, 2025), a day after unknown gunmen injured a Meitei farmer and a Kuki woman was shot dead later. A shutdown was observed across the Churachandpur district, dominated by the Kuki-Zo people, to protest the woman’s killing. She was identified as Hoikholhing Haokip, the wife of the chief of Langchingmanbi village adjoining the Bishnupur district, where the Meitei farmer was attacked. Also read | Manipur marks two years of ethnic violence by remembering victims The Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum had called the shutdown, demanding “immediate action against those responsible for this atrocity, concrete steps from the Centre to ensure the protection of tribal lives and territory, and an independent investigation into the repeated buffer zone violations.” The people of Bishnupur, one of the five districts comprising the Meitei-majority Imphal Valley, continued to block a highway leading to the Churachandpur district. They demanded the arrest of the assailants of farmer Ningthoujam Biren Singh, who was shot in his left arm on Thursday. Earlier, the Manipur Police said the security forces came under fire from unknown armed miscreants after the farmer was shot in Bishnupur’s Phubala area. “...the forces retaliated accordingly. During the crossfire, one woman from Langchingmanbi village was found dead with a bullet injury,” it said. Manipur, scarred by the ethnic conflict between the Kuki-Zos and Meiteis, was relatively calm after the imposition of the President’s Rule on February 13 this year. More than 250 people had died and some 60,000 were displaced in the clashes that had erupted on May 3, 2023. Meanwhile, the All Manipur United Clubs’ Organisation (AMUCO) condemned the Phubala incident, saying it suspected a conspiracy between the attackers and the security forces. It said the incident happened near a bunker of the Sashastra Seema Bal, whose personnel were inactive. The organisation underlined the importance of holding accountable the security personnel found complicit or negligent, apart from the attackers. “The people of Manipur express deep dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Home Affairs’ performance, as the region continues to grapple with ongoing conflicts and violence despite the government’s claims of working towards restoring normalcy,” the AMUCO said. The organisation also questioned the work done by security adviser Kuldiep Singh, who was sent by the Centre to resolve the ongoing crisis plaguing the State.
