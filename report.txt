**Manipur Violence: Coverage and Government Response**

Manipur, India, has been described as a region experiencing decades of violence [6]. The conflict has resulted in significant displacement, with over 60,000 internally displaced people remaining in camps after 27 months of violence, with no clear end in sight [7]. The death of Angom Prem Kumar is noted as an example of a deeper crisis that has moved beyond headlines into the despair of survivors [1][2].

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited Manipur, his first trip to the state since the ethnic violence began in May 2023, which has resulted in over 200 deaths [15][23]. During his visit, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated infrastructure projects valued at 1,200 crore [21] and other development projects [22][36]. He also inaugurated the new Manipur Police headquarters, valued at 101 crore, and the 538 crore civil secretariat [19]. The Prime Minister stated that his government is working on key projects to improve the lives of the people and enhance connectivity in the border state [17][19]. He also highlighted efforts to increase education facilities in tribal areas and strengthen local body governance, emphasizing the development of every tribal community as a national priority [28][29]. Prime Minister Modi also referred to Manipur as the "crown jewel adorning the crown of Mother India" [14] and hailed its contributions to India's freedom struggle, noting the renaming of Mount Harriet to Mount Manipur as a tribute to Manipuri freedom fighters [17]. He also mentioned GST 2.0 reforms as bringing double benefits to Manipur's people [17].

The BJP's State leadership presented the Prime Minister's visit as a confidence-building exercise [4]. However, activists from the youth wings of the Congress and Manipur Peoples' Party (MPP) held demonstrations protesting the visit, terming it a "political ploy" [27]. Prime Minister Modi has urged the Kuki-Zos to seek a "lasting political solution" in the form of a "separate administration" [23].

Accusations have been made against Manipur's government, alleging it has been "exploiting impunity" and "demonising the community" [8]. There are also statements suggesting that the Suspension of Operations (SoO) pact has not brought peace and that the appointed authority from Delhi cannot represent the people [5].

Reports indicate that the Indian government intends to "redouble its efforts to combat the violence" [9]. The Prime Minister has stated that the government is making all efforts to restore normalcy to Manipur [29].

Separately, a court in Manipur directed a report to be produced before the High Court on March 24 [38]. The government announced it would file a forensic report on the authenticity of leaked audio clips alleging the former chief minister N. Biren Singh's involvement in the ethnic violence [47]. Contradictory rulings have been reported regarding the authenticity of alleged audio clips of the chief minister [48]. The man accused of leaking these audio tapes intends to file a plea in the High Court [49]. A top court has ordered a report by the CFSL to be submitted within six weeks [50].

The provided claims do not contain counterclaims, rebuttals, or alternative viewpoints regarding the government's actions or the accusations made against it [8][5][27].

Other events mentioned include the inauguration of Mizoram entering the country's railway map by Chief Minister Lalduhoma [26], and Prime Minister Modi's upcoming inauguration of the Combined Commanders’ Conference in Assam [11]. Prime Minister Modi also visited Nepal [13] and congratulated Sushila Karki on becoming Nepal's first female Prime Minister [24]. He also stated that India is on track to become the third-largest economy globally [30].

Incidents of violence are also noted, including the death of a man in Manipur [1][2], and a shooting in Churachandpur district near a Sashastra Seema Bal bunker [51][52]. Several Meitei families displaced by ethnic violence are preparing to return to their homes under security cover [46]. The 5th Shirui Lily Festival in Manipur faced disruptions, with a bus allegedly blocking its route and a media team being stopped at checkpoints [44][45].
